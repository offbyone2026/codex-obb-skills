# Clinical Decision Support Documents

## Description

Generate professional clinical decision support (CDS) documents for pharmaceutical companies, clinical researchers, and medical decision-makers. This skill specializes in analytical, evidence-based documents that inform treatment strategies and drug development:

1. **Patient Cohort Analysis** - Biomarker-stratified group analyses with statistical outcome comparisons
2. **Treatment Recommendation Reports** - Evidence-based clinical guidelines with GRADE grading and decision algorithms

All documents are generated as publication-ready LaTeX/PDF files for pharmaceutical research, regulatory-support analyses, and clinical guideline development.

**Scope and safety:** these are decision-support documents for qualified clinicians, medical-affairs teams, and guideline panels — not orders for an individual patient. Every trial result, guideline recommendation, approval status, and grade must come from sources the user supplied or that you retrieved and cited in this session (e.g. via `alterlab-pubmed` or `alterlab-clinicaltrials`); never fill them in from memory, because a plausible but wrong hazard ratio or guideline category can propagate into prescribing decisions. Numbers in the examples below are illustrative placeholders. Include an AI-assistance disclosure and a "for expert review" notice in every document.

**Note:** For individual patient treatment plans at the bedside, use the `alterlab-treatment-plans` skill instead. For single-patient case reports for journal submission (e.g. CARE-guideline cases), use `alterlab-clinical-reports`. This skill focuses on group-level analyses and evidence synthesis for pharmaceutical/research settings.

**Writing Style:** For publication-ready documents targeting medical journals, consult the `alterlab-venue-templates` skill's `medical_journal_styles.md` for guidance on structured abstracts, evidence language, and CONSORT/STROBE compliance.

### Does NOT Trigger

| Scenario | Use Instead |
|----------|-------------|
| Individual patient treatment plan, bedside care documentation, or patient-specific protocol | `alterlab-treatment-plans` |
| Single-patient case report for journal submission (CARE) | `alterlab-clinical-reports` |
| Pooling effect sizes across published studies (random-effects model, I², funnel plot) | `alterlab-meta-analysis` |

## Document Structure

Start every CDS document with a one-page executive summary, before the table of contents or detailed sections. Readers in medical affairs and guideline panels decide from page 1 whether and how to read on, so it has to carry the key results on its own.

### Page 1 Executive Summary Structure

The first page of every CDS document should contain ONLY the executive summary with the following components:

**Required Elements (all on page 1):**
1. **Document Title and Type**
   - Main title (e.g., "Biomarker-Stratified Cohort Analysis" or "Evidence-Based Treatment Recommendations")
   - Subtitle with disease state and focus
   
2. **Report Information Box** (using colored tcolorbox)
   - Document type and purpose
   - Date of analysis/report
   - Disease state and patient population
   - Author/institution (if applicable)
   - Analysis framework or methodology
   
3. **Key Findings Boxes** (3-5 colored boxes using tcolorbox)
   - **Primary Results** (blue box): Main efficacy/outcome findings
   - **Biomarker Insights** (green box): Key molecular subtype findings
   - **Clinical Implications** (yellow/orange box): Actionable treatment implications
   - **Statistical Summary** (gray box): Hazard ratios, p-values, key statistics
   - **Safety Highlights** (red box, if applicable): Critical adverse events or warnings

**Visual Requirements:**
- Use `\thispagestyle{empty}` to remove page numbers from page 1
- All content must fit on page 1 (before `\newpage`)
- Use colored tcolorbox environments with different colors for visual hierarchy
- Boxes should be scannable and highlight most critical information
- Use bullet points, not narrative paragraphs
- End page 1 with `\newpage` before table of contents or detailed sections

| Ask | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Cohort/subgroup analysis, biomarker stratification, GRADE-graded guideline, pharma/RWE strategy doc (group-level) | **this skill** |
| Individual patient care plan, SMART goals, patient-specific dosing/monitoring for the chart | `alterlab-treatment-plans` |
| Single-patient case report for journal submission (e.g. CARE-guideline) | `alterlab-clinical-reports` |

Example for this skill: "Analyze 60 HER2+ breast cancer patients by hormone receptor status with survival outcomes."

## Example Usage

### Patient Cohort Analysis

> receiving pembrolizumab. Include outcomes: ORR, median PFS, median OS with hazard ratios 
> comparing PD-L1 ≥50% vs <50%. Generate Kaplan-Meier curves and waterfall plot.
```

**Example 2: GBM Molecular Subtype Analysis**
```
> Generate cohort analysis for 30 GBM patients classified into Cluster 1 (Mesenchymal-Immune-Active) 
> and Cluster 2 (Proneural) molecular subtypes. Compare outcomes including median OS, 6-month PFS rate, 
> and response to TMZ+bevacizumab. Include biomarker profile table and statistical comparison.
```

> and sequencing of daratumumab, carfilzomib, and CAR-T therapy. Provide flowchart showing decision points 
> at each line of therapy.
```

## Evidence Grading

This skill uses two complementary axes (see `references/treatment_recommendations.md` and `assets/recommendation_strength_guide.md` for the full matrix):

- **Recommendation strength** — Strong (Grade 1, "we recommend": benefits clearly outweigh risks) vs. Conditional/Weak (Grade 2, "we suggest": trade-offs exist, patient values matter). A third "Research" tier flags insufficient evidence.
- **Certainty of evidence** — High / Moderate / Low / Very Low, per the GRADE Working Group's domains (downgrade for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias; upgrade observational data for large effect, dose-response, plausible confounding).

The compact letter codes used throughout (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2C) are the **ACCP/Guyatt notation** (popularized by the ACCP/CHEST antithrombotic guidelines), which pairs the two axes into a single label. GRADE proper does not use these codes; report them as ACCP-style notation when both are cited, and never invent a grade not supported by the underlying evidence.

(Biomarker, outcome-metric, and statistical-method details are covered under **Capabilities** above and in the `references/` files.)

## Best Practices

### For Cohort Analyses

1. **Patient Selection Transparency**: Clearly document inclusion/exclusion criteria, patient flow, and reasons for exclusions
2. **Biomarker Clarity**: Specify assay methods, platforms (e.g., FoundationOne, Caris), cut-points, and validation status
3. **Statistical Rigor**: 
   - Report hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals, not just p-values
   - Include median follow-up time for survival analyses
   - Specify statistical tests used (log-rank, Cox regression, Fisher's exact)
   - Account for multiple comparisons when appropriate
4. **Outcome Definitions**: Use standard criteria:
   - Response: RECIST 1.1, iRECIST for immunotherapy
   - Adverse events: NCI CTCAE — v6.0 (released 2025; NCI-sponsored trials opening from January 2026) or whichever version the protocol specifies (many ongoing trials still use v5.0); state the version used
   - Performance status: ECOG or Karnofsky
5. **Survival Data Presentation**:
   - Median OS/PFS with 95% CI
   - Landmark survival rates (6-month, 12-month, 24-month)
   - Number at risk tables below Kaplan-Meier curves
   - Censoring clearly indicated
6. **Subgroup Analyses**: Pre-specify subgroups; clearly label exploratory vs pre-planned analyses
7. **Data Completeness**: Report missing data and how it was handled

### For Treatment Recommendation Reports

1. **Evidence Grading Transparency**: 
   - Use GRADE consistently, with ACCP-style codes (1A–2C) if a combined label is needed
   - Document rationale for each grade
   - Clearly state quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low)
2. **Comprehensive Evidence Review**: 
   - Include phase 3 randomized trials as primary evidence
   - Supplement with phase 2 data for emerging therapies
   - Note real-world evidence and meta-analyses
   - Cite trial names (e.g., KEYNOTE-189, CheckMate-227) with a verifiable reference (PMID/DOI or registry ID)
3. **Biomarker-Guided Recommendations**:
   - Link specific biomarkers to therapy recommendations
   - Specify testing methods and validated assays
   - Include FDA/EMA approval status for companion diagnostics, checked against current labeling (approvals change)
4. **Clinical Actionability**: Every recommendation should have clear implementation guidance
5. **Decision Algorithm Clarity**: TikZ flowcharts should be unambiguous with clear yes/no decision points
6. **Special Populations**: Address elderly, renal/hepatic impairment, pregnancy, drug interactions
7. **Monitoring Guidance**: Specify safety labs, imaging, and frequency
8. **Update Frequency**: Date recommendations and plan for periodic updates

### General Best Practices

1. **First Page Executive Summary**: 
   - Create a complete executive summary that fills page 1
   - Use 3-5 colored tcolorbox elements to highlight key findings
   - No table of contents or detailed sections on page 1
   - Use `\thispagestyle{empty}` and end with `\newpage`
   - This is the single most important page - it should be scannable in 60 seconds
2. **De-identification**: Remove all 18 HIPAA identifiers before document generation (Safe Harbor method)
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Include confidentiality notices for proprietary pharmaceutical data
4. **Publication-Ready Formatting**: Use 0.5in margins, professional fonts, color-coded sections
5. **Reproducibility**: Document all statistical methods to enable replication
6. **Conflict of Interest**: Disclose pharmaceutical funding or relationships when applicable
7. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use colored boxes consistently (blue=data, green=biomarkers, yellow/orange=recommendations, red=warnings)
