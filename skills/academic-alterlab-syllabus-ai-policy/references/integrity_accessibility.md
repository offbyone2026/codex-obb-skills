# Assessment-Integrity, Accessibility & Equity Language

Wording and checklists for the three clauses that surround the per-task tiers.
All wording here is **parameterized** — it never asserts a fact about a specific
tool (accuracy, compliance, accessibility) unless the instructor supplies it.

## 1. Integrity binding

A policy is only enforceable if prohibited-tier misuse is tied to the named
institutional process. One sentence, with the code reference filled in:

```
Use of generative AI on a task marked "Prohibited" in this syllabus, or
undisclosed use on a task marked "Restricted" or "Permitted", is an academic-
integrity violation and is handled under <CODE_REF>.
```

- `<CODE_REF>` is inserted **verbatim** from what the instructor supplies
  (e.g. a student disciplinary regulation, an honor code, a faculty handbook
  section). 
- If the instructor has **not** supplied it, leave the `<CODE_REF>` placeholder
  in place and say so in the hand-back. **Never invent a regulation name,
  article number, or URL.** An invented code reference is worse than a visible
  placeholder because it looks authoritative while being false.

## 2. Accessibility & equity checklist

Two realities every AI policy should acknowledge:

- **Assistive use is not misuse.** Some students rely on AI-backed assistive
  tools (e.g. for reading, writing, or language support) as an accommodation.
  The policy should state that documented assistive use is permitted and is not
  an integrity concern. Do not enumerate specific approved products unless the
  instructor names them — accommodations are determined by the disability office,
  not the syllabus.
- **Access is unequal.** Paid AI tiers are not universal. If a task *requires* AI
  use (a Permitted/encouraged tier), the policy should ensure it is achievable
  on a free tier, or that institutional access is provided. Otherwise required
  AI use becomes a hidden cost barrier.

Checklist the lint and the author should run:

- [ ] Assistive/accommodation use explicitly carved out as permitted.
- [ ] Any *required* AI use is free-tier-achievable or institutionally provided.
- [ ] No claim that a named tool is "accurate", "secure", "FERPA/KVKK-compliant",
      or "accessible" — unless the instructor supplied that fact with a source.
- [ ] Students warned that AI can fabricate facts/citations and remain
      responsible for verifying any AI-assisted output.

## 3. The detector-as-evidence caution

If asked to lean the policy on an "AI detector":

- State that detector outputs are **probabilistic**, carry false-positive and
  false-negative rates, and are documented to disadvantage some groups — e.g.
  detectors flagged non-native English writers' essays as AI-generated far more
  often (Liang et al., 2023, *Patterns* 4(7):100779,
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2023.100779). They should inform, not decide.
- The syllabus states **process** (how a suspected case is reviewed under the
  integrity code), it does not pronounce guilt. A detector score alone is not a
  finding.

Recommended wording:

```
AI-detection tools, if used, are one input to a review under <CODE_REF> and are
never the sole basis for an integrity finding; their results are probabilistic.
```

## 4. What this skill does NOT do

To keep the boundary sharp (and matching the SKILL.md routing table):

- It does **not** adjudicate an individual suspected case or run a detector on a
  submission. That is a teaching/assessment task — route to
  `alterlab-teaching-design`.
- It does **not** rule on the ethics of using an AI tool on **human-subjects
  research data** (IRB, consent, de-identification) — route to
  `alterlab-research-ethics`, or `alterlab-tr-research-ethics` for the
  Turkish ÜAK/YÖK ethics-board workflow.
- It does **not** verify that citations a student produced actually exist —
  route to `alterlab-citation-verifier`.
