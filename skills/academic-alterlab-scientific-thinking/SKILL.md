# Scientific Critical Thinking

## Overview

Critical thinking is a systematic process for evaluating scientific rigor. Assess methodology, experimental design, statistical validity, biases, confounding, and evidence quality using GRADE and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tools (RoB 2 for randomized trials, ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies of interventions). Apply this skill for critical analysis of scientific claims.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Evaluating research methodology and experimental design
- Assessing statistical validity and evidence quality
- Identifying biases and confounding in studies
- Reviewing scientific claims and conclusions
- Appraising included studies for a systematic review (risk of bias, GRADE certainty)
- Applying GRADE or Cochrane risk of bias assessments
- Providing critical analysis of research papers

### Does NOT Trigger

| Scenario | Use Instead |
|----------|-------------|
| Writing a formal, submittable reviewer report for a journal or grant | `alterlab-peer-review` |
| A multi-reviewer mock panel verdict on a whole manuscript | `alterlab-paper-reviewer` |
| Rubric scores for a paper, thesis, or proposal | `alterlab-scholar-eval` |
| Running the statistical test or model itself | `alterlab-statistical-analysis` |
| Pooling effect sizes across studies (forest plots, heterogeneity, publication bias) | `alterlab-meta-analysis` |

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Methodology Critique

Evaluate research methodology for rigor, validity, and potential flaws.

**Apply when:**
- Reviewing research papers
- Assessing experimental designs
- Evaluating study protocols
- Planning new research

**Evaluation framework:**

1. **Study Design Assessment**
   - Is the design appropriate for the research question?
   - Can the design support causal claims being made?
   - Are comparison groups appropriate and adequate?
   - Consider whether experimental, quasi-experimental, or observational design is justified

2. **Validity Analysis**
   - **Internal validity:** Can we trust the causal inference?
     - Check randomization quality
     - Evaluate confounding control
     - Assess selection bias
     - Review attrition/dropout patterns
   - **External validity:** Do results generalize?
     - Evaluate sample representativeness
     - Consider ecological validity of setting
     - Assess whether conditions match target application
   - **Construct validity:** Do measures capture intended constructs?
     - Review measurement validation
     - Check operational definitions
     - Assess whether measures are direct or proxy
   - **Statistical conclusion validity:** Are statistical inferences sound?
     - Verify adequate power/sample size
     - Check assumption compliance
     - Evaluate test appropriateness

3. **Control and Blinding**
   - Was randomization properly implemented (sequence generation, allocation concealment)?
   - Was blinding feasible and implemented (participants, providers, assessors)?
   - Are control conditions appropriate (placebo, active control, no treatment)?
   - Could performance or detection bias affect results?

4. **Measurement Quality**
   - Are instruments validated and reliable?
   - Are measures objective when possible, or subjective with acknowledged limitations?
   - Is outcome assessment standardized?
   - Are multiple measures used to triangulate findings?

**Reference:** See `references/scientific_method.md` for detailed principles and `references/experimental_design.md` for comprehensive design checklist.

### 2. Bias Detection

Identify and evaluate potential sources of bias that could distort findings.

**Apply when:**
- Reviewing published research
- Designing new studies
- Interpreting conflicting evidence
- Assessing research quality

**Systematic bias review** spans five families: cognitive biases (confirmation, HARKing, publication bias, cherry-picking), selection biases (sampling, volunteer, attrition, survivorship), measurement biases (observer, recall, social desirability, instrument), analysis biases (p-hacking, outcome switching, selective reporting, subgroup fishing), and confounding (measured, unmeasured, and alternative explanations).

**Reference:** Full detection-question checklist for every bias in each family moved to `references/evaluation_checklists.md` (Bias Detection section). See `references/common_biases.md` for the comprehensive bias taxonomy with mitigation strategies.

### 3. Statistical Analysis Evaluation

Critically assess statistical methods, interpretation, and reporting.

**Apply when:**
- Reviewing quantitative research
- Evaluating data-driven claims
- Assessing clinical trial results
- Reviewing meta-analyses

**Statistical review checklist** covers eight areas: sample size and power, statistical test appropriateness, multiple-comparison correction, p-value interpretation, effect sizes and confidence intervals, missing-data handling, regression/modeling assumptions, and common pitfalls (correlation-as-causation, regression to the mean, base-rate neglect, Texas sharpshooter, Simpson's paradox).

**Reference:** Full question-by-question checklist for all eight areas moved to `references/evaluation_checklists.md` (Statistical Analysis Evaluation section). See `references/statistical_pitfalls.md` for detailed pitfalls and correct practices.

### 4. Evidence Quality Assessment

Evaluate the strength and quality of evidence systematically.

**Apply when:**
- Weighing evidence for decisions
- Conducting literature reviews
- Comparing conflicting findings
- Determining confidence in conclusions

**Evidence evaluation framework** works through five components: the study-design hierarchy (meta-analysis down to expert opinion, with the caveat that level does not guarantee quality), quality within a design type (risk-of-bias tools, rigor, transparency, conflicts of interest), GRADE considerations (start from design type, then downgrade/upgrade), convergence of evidence (what makes it stronger vs. weaker), and contextual factors (plausibility, consistency, temporality, specificity, strength).

**Reference:** Full framework with the complete GRADE downgrade/upgrade criteria and convergence signals moved to `references/evaluation_checklists.md` (Evidence Quality Assessment section). See `references/evidence_hierarchy.md` for the detailed hierarchy, GRADE system, and quality assessment tools.

### 5. Logical Fallacy Identification

Detect and name logical errors in scientific arguments and claims.

**Apply when:**
- Evaluating scientific claims
- Reviewing discussion/conclusion sections
- Assessing popular science communication
- Identifying flawed reasoning

**Common fallacies in science** fall into six categories: causation fallacies (post hoc, correlation = causation, reverse causation, single cause), generalization fallacies (hasty generalization, anecdotal, cherry-picking, ecological), authority/source fallacies (appeal to authority, ad hominem, genetic, appeal to nature), statistical fallacies (base-rate neglect, Texas sharpshooter, multiple comparisons, prosecutor's fallacy), structural fallacies (false dichotomy, moving goalposts, begging the question, straw man), and science-specific fallacies (Galileo gambit, argument from ignorance, nirvana fallacy, unfalsifiability).

**Reference:** Full fallacy catalog with the plain-language definition of each named fallacy moved to `references/evaluation_checklists.md` (Logical Fallacy Identification section). See `references/logical_fallacies.md` for examples and detection strategies.

**When identifying fallacies:**
- Name the specific fallacy
- Explain why the reasoning is flawed
- Identify what evidence would be needed for valid inference
- Note that fallacious reasoning doesn't prove the conclusion false—just that this argument doesn't support it

**Reference:** See `references/logical_fallacies.md` for comprehensive fallacy catalog with examples and detection strategies.

### 6. Research Design Guidance

Provide constructive guidance for planning rigorous studies.

**Apply when:**
- Helping design new experiments
- Planning research projects
- Reviewing research proposals
- Improving study protocols

**Design process:**

1. **Research Question Refinement**
   - Ensure question is specific, answerable, and falsifiable
   - Verify it addresses a gap or contradiction in literature
   - Confirm feasibility (resources, ethics, time)
   - Define variables operationally

2. **Design Selection**
   - Match design to question (causal → experimental; associational → observational)
   - Consider feasibility and ethical constraints
   - Choose between-subjects, within-subjects, or mixed designs
   - Plan factorial designs if testing multiple factors

3. **Bias Minimization Strategy**
   - Implement randomization when possible
   - Plan blinding at all feasible levels (participants, providers, assessors)
   - Identify and plan to control confounds (randomization, matching, stratification, statistical adjustment)
   - Standardize all procedures
   - Plan to minimize attrition

4. **Sample Planning**
   - Conduct a priori power analysis (specify expected effect, desired power, alpha)
   - Account for attrition in sample size
   - Define clear inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - Consider recruitment strategy and feasibility
   - Plan for sample representativeness

5. **Measurement Strategy**
   - Select validated, reliable instruments
   - Use objective measures when possible
   - Plan multiple measures of key constructs (triangulation)
   - Ensure measures are sensitive to expected changes
   - Establish inter-rater reliability procedures

6. **Analysis Planning**
   - Prespecify all hypotheses and analyses
   - Designate primary outcome clearly
   - Plan statistical tests with assumption checks
   - Specify how missing data will be handled
   - Plan to report effect sizes and confidence intervals
   - Consider multiple comparison corrections

7. **Transparency and Rigor**
   - Preregister study and analysis plan
   - Use reporting guidelines (CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA)
   - Plan to report all outcomes, not just significant ones
   - Distinguish confirmatory from exploratory analyses
   - Commit to data/code sharing

**Reference:** See `references/experimental_design.md` for comprehensive design checklist covering all stages from question to dissemination.

### 7. Claim Evaluation

Systematically evaluate scientific claims for validity and support.

**Apply when:**
- Assessing conclusions in papers
- Evaluating media reports of research
- Reviewing abstract or introduction claims
- Checking if data support conclusions

**Claim evaluation process:**

1. **Identify the Claim**
   - What exactly is being claimed?
   - Is it a causal claim, associational claim, or descriptive claim?
   - How strong is the claim (proven, likely, suggested, possible)?

2. **Assess the Evidence**
   - What evidence is provided?
   - Is evidence direct or indirect?
   - Is evidence sufficient for the strength of claim?
   - Are alternative explanations ruled out?

3. **Check Logical Connection**
   - Do conclusions follow from the data?
   - Are there logical leaps?
   - Is correlational data used to support causal claims?
   - Are limitations acknowledged?

4. **Evaluate Proportionality**
   - Is confidence proportional to evidence strength?
   - Are hedging words used appropriately?
   - Are limitations downplayed?
   - Is speculation clearly labeled?

5. **Check for Overgeneralization**
   - Do claims extend beyond the sample studied?
   - Are population restrictions acknowledged?
   - Is context-dependence recognized?
   - Are caveats about generalization included?

6. **Red Flags**
   - Causal language from correlational studies
   - "Proves" or absolute certainty
   - Cherry-picked citations
   - Ignoring contradictory evidence
   - Dismissing limitations
   - Extrapolation beyond data

**Provide specific feedback:**
- Quote the problematic claim
- Explain what evidence would be needed to support it
- Suggest appropriate hedging language if warranted
- Distinguish between data (what was found) and interpretation (what it means)

## Application Guidelines

### General Approach

1. **Be Constructive**
   - Identify strengths as well as weaknesses
   - Suggest improvements rather than just criticizing
   - Distinguish between fatal flaws and minor limitations
   - Recognize that all research has limitations

2. **Be Specific**
   - Point to specific instances (e.g., "Table 2 shows..." or "In the Methods section...")
   - Quote problematic statements
   - Provide concrete examples of issues
   - Reference specific principles or standards violated

3. **Be Proportionate**
   - Match criticism severity to issue importance
   - Distinguish between major threats to validity and minor concerns
   - Consider whether issues affect primary conclusions
   - Acknowledge uncertainty in your own assessments

4. **Apply Consistent Standards**
   - Use same criteria across all studies
   - Don't apply stricter standards to findings you dislike
   - Acknowledge your own potential biases
   - Base judgments on methodology, not results

5. **Consider Context**
   - Acknowledge practical and ethical constraints
   - Consider field-specific norms for effect sizes and methods
   - Recognize exploratory vs. confirmatory contexts
   - Account for resource limitations in evaluating studies

### When Providing Critique

**Structure feedback as:**

1. **Summary:** Brief overview of what was evaluated
2. **Strengths:** What was done well (important for credibility and learning)
3. **Concerns:** Issues organized by severity
   - Critical issues (threaten validity of main conclusions)
   - Important issues (affect interpretation but not fatally)
   - Minor issues (worth noting but don't change conclusions)
4. **Specific Recommendations:** Actionable suggestions for improvement
5. **Overall Assessment:** Balanced conclusion about evidence quality and what can be concluded

**Use precise terminology:**
- Name specific biases, fallacies, and methodological issues
- Reference established standards and guidelines
- Cite principles from scientific methodology
- Use technical terms accurately

### When Uncertain

- **Acknowledge uncertainty:** "This could be X or Y; additional information needed is Z"
- **Ask clarifying questions:** "Was [methodological detail] done? This affects interpretation."
- **Provide conditional assessments:** "If X was done, then Y follows; if not, then Z is concern"
- **Note what additional information would resolve uncertainty**
