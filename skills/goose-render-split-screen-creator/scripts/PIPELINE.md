# Pipeline — split-screen creator

How `config.example.json` maps to the real production steps. This capability
ships a **config + this map** — the FREE assembly + captions stage. The worked
example (Perplexity concept-10 "Bloomberg terminal") was produced by the per-scene
paid steps plus the split-screen assembler + the caption burn.

The steps run **in order** because each depends on the last: the script sets the
scene count, the VO + its per-scene timing drive the bottom-zone slices, the
locked voice + anchor drive the ONE VEED Fabric lip-sync take, the brand clips
fill the top zone, assembly stitches the two zones, and captions come from the
ASSEMBLED cut (not the raw VO).

The creator (gender, age, look), setting, tone and caption style are the user's
choices, made upstream. The Perplexity values in `config.example.json` (creator,
`arlo` voice, script, `#20808D` divider, `serif-accent`) are the worked example's
build — never defaults.

## Field → source-step map

| Config field | Phase | Source step | Paid? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `voiceover.*`, `scenes[].vo` | 1 VO | ElevenLabs `eleven_v3` with-timestamps (`create-vo-elevenlabs`) → vo mp3 + timestamp JSON | **PAID** (~$0.06) |
| `scenes[].start/end`, `voiceover.outputs.timing` | 1 VO | slice per-scene start/end from the char timestamps → `timing.json` | free |
| `creator.anchor` | 2 Creator | photoreal MEDIUM chest-up anchor, `gpt-image-2` (`create-image-gpt-image-fal`) | **PAID** (~$0.10) |
| `creator.lipsync_*` | 2 Creator | **VEED Fabric 1.0 @ 720p — a NO-ATOM paid step** (`image_url` = anchor, `audio_url` = vo mp3) → creator lip-sync mp4 | **PAID** (~$5.90 / 39s) |
| `scenes[].top_clip` + `top_start/top_end` | 3 Top | brand-owned 16:9 UI screen-recordings (S02–SN) + the scene-1 hook graphic | (brand-supplied) |
| `layout.*`, `endcard.*`, assembly | 4 Assembly | the split-screen assembler — two-zone composite + hard-concat + end card → `master-precaption.mp4` | free |
| `captions.*` | 5 Captions | transcribe the ASSEMBLED cut (local `faster-whisper`) → word-level ASS burn → `concept-<n>-final-ad.mp4` | free |

## 1. Voiceover (config `voiceover`, `scenes[].vo`) — PAID

**Lock the script first** — ~6 scenes, one VO sentence per scene, each naming one
claim. Call ElevenLabs `eleven_v3` on the **with-timestamps** endpoint → the vo
mp3 + character-level timestamps. Slice per-scene start/end boundaries into
`timing.json` (`{"scenes":[{"scene":N,"start":s,"end":e}]}`). Creator-native VO
reads ~1.15–1.2×; apply `atempo` if it runs fast. **Lock the voice here** — a
second voice doubles the VEED spend downstream. This is upstream of the capability.

## 2. Creator anchor + lip-sync (config `creator`) — PAID, no-atom VEED step

A **photoreal MEDIUM chest-up** `gpt-image-2` anchor of the user-chosen creator
(`creator.brief`: gender, age, look, setting) at a natural webcam distance —
whole head with headroom, shoulders + upper chest, real lived-in room, anti-AI skin
cues — **not** a plain-background close-up headshot and **not** a phone-selfie pose
(borrow another format's realism, never its arm-extended framing). Watch the source
video first and match its creator distance; get the anchor framing right BEFORE the
lip-sync, since a too-close image can't be reframed in the composite. Then the
**whole VO** lip-synced in **one VEED Fabric 1.0 take @ 720p** (`veed/fabric-1.0`,
`image_url` = the portrait, `audio_url` = the vo mp3) → the creator lip-sync mp4.
**VEED Fabric is a no-atom paid step** — there is no `create-lipsync-*` atom; it's
an external FAL call (~$0.15/sec, ~$5.90 for a 39s VO). Always 720p — 480p reads
soft in the bottom zone. Run the lip-sync call(s) **sequentially with a `sleep`** —
`veed/fabric-1.0` storage-auths 403 under parallel load. Upstream of the capability;
the lip-sync take is a supplied input.

## 3. Top-zone clips + hook graphic (config `scenes[].top_clip`)

One brand-owned 16:9 UI screen-recording per demo scene (≥1920×1080), each showing
exactly what its VO line says (the #1 quality lever). Render the scene-1 hook
graphic (kinetic title-card / stat claim) separately. Confirm the end-card clip;
note the last **sharp** second before any fade-to-black as `endcard.clip_end`.

## 4. Ad-spec + assembly (config `layout`, `scenes[].top_*`, `endcard`) — FREE

Author the ad-spec (canvas 1080×1920, `top_height` ~998, `divider_color`, per-scene
`top_clip` + `top_start`/`top_end`, `endcard.clip` + `clip_end`) and run the
split-screen assembler. Per scene: TOP zone = the clip **contain-fit** + a darkened
**blurred cover-scale of the same clip** filling the letterbox margins (never
charcoal/black bars); a 3px brand-color divider (keep stacked heights EVEN, e.g.
998+4+918=1920, or libx264 rejects the odd frame); BOTTOM zone = the creator lip-sync
framed head-to-shoulders (scale-to-width × ZOOM ~1.15–1.2, then crop with a downward
offset so the face is upper-middle and the shoulders enter — NOT a plain crop-toward-top,
which cuts the shoulders). Tune zoom/offset visually (free re-assemble). **Never loop a
short clip** — window it and the assembler speed-fits it. Hard-concat the scenes; body audio =
the concatenated creator VO slices; append the end card holding the last sharp frame
~3s → `master-precaption.mp4`. Deterministic, $0.

## 5. Captions (config `captions`) — FREE

**Caption the ASSEMBLED cut, not the raw VO** — concat drops inter-scene silence, so
the ad timeline ≠ the VO timeline; only the final cut's audio yields correct caption
timing. Transcribe `master-precaption.mp4` with local `faster-whisper`, build
word-level cues (sentence-aware chunking), and burn the ASS in `captions.style`
(`serif-accent`, `kinetic-pop`, `neon-glow`, `clean-bubble`) → `concept-<n>-final-ad.mp4`.
Keep the `-precaption` cut + the `.ass` sidecar so captions restyle without
re-rendering the composite. If the host ffmpeg lacks libass, render the cues as timed
PIL PNG overlays composited with ffmpeg `overlay=…:enable='between(t,st,en)'` instead.

Re-cuts (re-timed windows, a swapped blurred-fill, new caption chunking, a restyle, a
longer end-card hold) reuse the existing VO / lip-sync / clips and cost **$0** — only
steps 1–2 spend.
