## Chinese Citation Format Switching

### APA 7.0 Chinese Format

For complete specifications, see `apa7_chinese_citation_guide.md`. Below is a quick reference.

**Chinese journal article**:
```
Wang, Da-Ming, & Li, Xiao-Hua (2024). Article title. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx
```

**Chinese book**:
```
Zhang, San (2023). Book title. Publisher.
```

**Government publication**:
```
Ministry of Education (2024). Publication title. https://url
```

### Mixed Chinese-English Reference Handling

**In-text citations**:
- Chinese uses full-width parentheses: (Author, Year)
- English uses half-width parentheses: (Author, Year)
- Chinese multiple authors use enumeration comma; English uses &

**Reference list ordering**:

| Option | Description | Applicable Scenario |
|------|------|---------|
| **Option A (Recommended)** | Chinese first (ordered by stroke count), English after (ordered alphabetically) | Convention for most Taiwan journals |
| **Option B** | Mixed Chinese-English ordering (unified stroke count / alphabetical) | Some international journals |

**Same author with both Chinese and English works**: List separately — Chinese works go in the Chinese section, English works go in the English section.

### Format Conversion Notes (Chinese Papers)

**Chinese APA → Chicago**:
1. Publication format differs (APA 7 does not require publication location, Chicago does)
2. Change titles to "title case" format
3. Add footnote citation system

**Chinese APA → IEEE**:
1. Add numbered labels [N]
2. Remove year from after author position
3. Order by citation appearance (not stroke count)

**Chinese paper format conventions**:
- Most Taiwan journals use APA
- Humanities disciplines (history, literature) occasionally use Chicago
- Engineering/CS fields mostly use IEEE
- Medical fields use Vancouver

## AI-Generated Content Citation (by Format)

| Format | How to Cite AI |
|--------|---------------|
| APA 7th | APA's September 2025 guidance (it replaced the 2023 "Mar 14 version" example). A specific chat: `AI Company. (Year, Month Day). *Title of chat* [Generative AI chat]. Tool name/model. URL of shared chat`. The tool in general: OpenAI. (2025). *ChatGPT (GPT-5)* [Large language model]. https://chatgpt.com/ — the author is the company; in-text (OpenAI, 2025) |
| Chicago 18th | Cite in a note or in the text, not the bibliography: "1. Text generated by ChatGPT-4, OpenAI, September 30, 2024, [public share URL]." Add a bibliography entry only if a publicly accessible share link exists (CMOS 18 §14.112) |
| MLA 9th | MLA Style Center, revised August 2025 (the model goes in the version element; the share URL is preferred): "Describe the theme of nature in Jane Austen's Mansfield Park" prompt. *ChatGPT*, model GPT-4o, OpenAI, 23 Sept. 2024, chatgpt.com/share/… |
| IEEE | No official IEEE pattern; follow the target venue. Common form: [N] OpenAI, "ChatGPT," ver. [version], [year]. [Online]. Available: [URL] |
| Vancouver | No official NLM pattern; follow the target journal. Common form: OpenAI. ChatGPT [Large language model]. [Year]. Available from: [URL] |

Most journals also require an AI-use disclosure statement (methods or acknowledgments) in addition to, or instead of, a citation — `alterlab-ai-use-disclosure` drafts it against the target venue's current policy. Full templates for both styles: `alterlab-syllabus-ai-policy` (`references/disclosure_and_citation.md`).
