"""Plan the creator's talking takes and write their prompts. Free, no network.

    plan_takes.py --beats cutlist.json --character character.json --out work/takes \
        [--mannerism mannerism.mp4] [--aspect 9:16] [--resolution 1080P]

--beats is any file with `beats: [{id, start, end, vo}]` (the footage-cutlist cut list
works as-is). --character is:

    {"image": "character.png",                     # the approved still, local path
     "identity": "<age, gender, look the user chose>", # who they are, VERBATIM into every take
     "environment": "<the room in the approved still>", # the room, VERBATIM into every take
     "delivery": "<the tone the user chose>"}           # optional: how they speak

The person, the room and the tone are the USER'S choices (the recipe's `choices`); this
script has no default person or room. Without `delivery` a neutral conversational read is
used and a note is printed.

Writes <out>/takes.json (run_takes.py's spec) and <out>/<id>-prompt.txt per take.

TAKES SPLIT ON LINE BOUNDARIES, never inside a line. H3 caps a take at 15s, so a 30s
script is two or three takes. A join between two lines can be hidden with a 0.10s
dissolve (join_takes.py); a join mid-sentence cannot.

EACH TAKE RUNS 0.6s PAST ITS LAST WORD, rounded up to whole seconds (H3 takes whole
seconds, 5-15). A take planned to exactly its words clipped the last word of a reel.

THE PROMPT is the one that held identity and eyeline across the reference builds. The
person and the room come from character.json word for word, so every take describes the
same person the same way; nothing about a person is written here. Square brackets in a
line are refused: H3 speaks them aloud.

ASPECT: 9:16 when the creator ever fills the frame, otherwise the closest H3 ratio to the
creator's zone. Cropping a 16:9 take to 9:16 is a 2.5x upscale.

The hands are FREE and gesture while talking, one coming up and settling. Nobody holds the phone, there is no arm extended toward the camera. THE CAMERA DOES NOT MOVE: locked off, no handheld drift, no pan, no zoom, no reframing. One continuous unbroken shot.

EYES STAY ON THE CAMERA LENS FOR THE WHOLE CLIP, from the very first frame to the very last, including the final word. Never glancing away, never looking down, never letting the gaze drift off the lens at the end of a sentence.

THE SUBJECT AND THE SET, unchanged from the first frame to the last, exactly as <Picture 1>: {identity}

SKIN matches <Picture 1> exactly: visible pores, no smoothing, no plastic gloss, no over-sharpened edges. The light is the light in <Picture 1> and it does not change.

DIEGETIC SOUND: the voice and quiet room tone only.
AUDIO RESTRICTIONS: no music, no beat, no sound design, no second voice, and no robotic, synthetic, text-to-speech, monotone or announcer-like delivery. The spoken audio contains ONLY the words inside the dialogue block. No stage directions and no markup is ever spoken aloud.
