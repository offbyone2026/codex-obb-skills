Writes <out>/character.png and <out>/character.json, the latter ready for plan_takes.py.

WHY THIS EXISTS

`character-prompt.json` held a carefully built realism formula and **no script read it**. The
skill told whoever was running it to "fill its slots, generate 2-4 options, let the user pick
one". That is three failures at once:

1. Slots got left unfilled. The formula's own note says the model "drifts to an ambiguous
   composite face" without explicit age, ethnicity and sex. An unspecified person IS the
   composite face a reviewer calls "obviously AI".
2. Every run filled the slots differently, so quality depended on who was driving.
3. "generate 2-4 options and pick" is iteration. A template a customer runs has to land the
   first time.

This makes it one command: the identity slots come from the user and are REQUIRED; the craft
slots (imperfections, framing, light) come from the formula and are not the user's problem.

EVERY SLOT IS FILLED OR THE RUN STOPS. A blank slot is how the composite face gets in.

# The formula's own capture grammar is a STUDIO PORTRAIT: medium format film, a raking
# side-top key at 45 degrees, shallow depth of field, film grain. Its SKIN engine is right and
# measures in range (detail 6.9-11.2 against 6.2-10.6 for real reference footage), but the
# capture grammar is what makes a correct-skinned face still read as generated: real creator
# footage is a phone, and it is flatter, deeper-focused and much less saturated.
#
# Measured 2026-09-30, real references vs our renders (mean per-pixel saturation):
#     Salary Transparent 0.262 · Chris Klemens 0.182 · Arcads real actor 0.135
#     ours: man46 0.364 · man31 0.217 · woman27 0.507
