# Treatment Plan Writing

## Overview

Treatment plan writing is the systematic documentation of clinical care strategies designed to address patient health conditions through evidence-based interventions, measurable goals, and structured follow-up. This skill provides LaTeX templates and validation tools for creating **concise, focused** treatment plans (3-4 pages standard) across all medical specialties with full regulatory compliance.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Concise and actionable**: Treatment plans default to 3-4 pages maximum (1 page preferred for standard cases), focusing only on clinically essential information that impacts care decisions
2. **Patient-Centered**: Plans must be evidence-based, measurable, and compliant with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, documentation standards)
3. **Minimal Citations**: Use brief in-text citations only when needed; avoid extensive bibliographies (0-3 citations max in a 3-4 page plan)

Every treatment plan should include clear goals, specific interventions, defined timelines, monitoring parameters, and expected outcomes that align with patient preferences and current clinical guidelines — all presented as efficiently as possible.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating individualized treatment plans for patient care
- Documenting therapeutic interventions for chronic disease management
- Developing rehabilitation programs (physical, occupational, cardiac)
- Writing mental health and psychiatric treatment plans
- Planning perioperative and surgical care pathways
- Establishing pain management protocols
- Setting patient-centered goals using SMART criteria
- Coordinating multidisciplinary care across specialties
- Ensuring regulatory compliance in treatment documentation

### Does NOT Trigger

| Scenario | Use Instead |
|----------|-------------|
| Population-level treatment recommendations or guidelines with GRADE grading, or a biomarker-stratified cohort analysis | `alterlab-clinical-decision` |
| Documenting care that already happened (SOAP note, H&P, discharge summary) or a journal case report | `alterlab-clinical-reports` |
| Pharmacogenomic dosing guidance (CPIC/DPWG) for a gene–drug pair | `alterlab-clinpgx` |
| Looking up drug properties, targets, or drug–drug interactions | `alterlab-drugbank` |

## Clinical Safety

A treatment plan is a draft for the treating clinician to review, adapt, and sign — not an order. Build it only from the patient information the user provides, and mark missing items (allergies, renal function, current medications) as blanks to complete rather than guessing, because a plausible default dose or omitted interaction check can cause harm. Check every drug, dose, and monitoring interval against current labeling and guidelines the clinician can verify, cite guideline sources the user supplied or that you retrieved in this session, and never invent a citation. Include a short AI-assistance note in the document.

## Core Workflow

1. **Choose format and length.** Default to the 1-page quick-reference card; expand to the 3-4 page standard format (first-page summary + details) only when complexity demands. See `references/document_formats.md`.
2. **Build the mandatory first-page executive summary.** Title + report info box + 2-4 colored key-findings boxes (goals, interventions, decision points). This page can often stand alone. Full spec and LaTeX skeleton in `references/document_formats.md`.
3. **Pick the specialty template** from `assets/` and fill its component sections. Component checklists per specialty (general medical, rehab, mental health, chronic disease, perioperative, pain) are in `references/specialty_components.md`.
4. **Write SMART goals** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) for short- and long-term horizons.
5. **Apply professional styling** with the `medical_treatment_plan.sty` package — see `references/latex_styling.md`.
6. **Validate, then generate PDF.** Run completeness and quality checks, compare against the quality checklist, then compile. See `references/templates_and_validation.md`.

## Six Specialty Plan Types

| # | Type | Template (`assets/`) | Use for |
|---|------|----------------------|---------|
| 1 | General Medical | `general_medical_treatment_plan.tex` | Chronic disease, acute medical, primary care |
| 2 | Rehabilitation | `rehabilitation_treatment_plan.tex` | PT/OT/SLP, post-surgery, injury recovery |
| 3 | Mental Health | `mental_health_treatment_plan.tex` | Psychiatric conditions, behavioral health |
| 4 | Chronic Disease | `chronic_disease_management_plan.tex` | Complex multi-condition long-term care |
| 5 | Perioperative | `perioperative_care_plan.tex` | Surgical/procedural pre-, peri-, post-op |
| 6 | Pain Management | `pain_management_plan.tex` | Acute/chronic pain, opioid-sparing multimodal |

Per-specialty required component breakdowns (assessments, goals, interventions, monitoring, education, risk mitigation) are documented in **[`references/specialty_components.md`](references/specialty_components.md)**.

## Quick Generation

```bash
# Interactive template selection
python scripts/generate_template.py

# Or specify type directly. Default to one_page (the preferred quick-reference
# format) for most cases; pick a specialty template when complexity demands it.
python scripts/generate_template.py --type one_page --output diabetes_plan.tex
python scripts/generate_template.py --type mental_health --output depression_treatment_plan.tex

# Type choices: one_page, general_medical, rehabilitation, mental_health,
#               chronic_disease, perioperative, pain_management

# Validate, then compile
python scripts/check_completeness.py plan.tex
python scripts/validate_treatment_plan.py plan.tex
pdflatex plan.tex
```

## Professional Document Styling

Treatment plans can be enhanced with professional medical document styling using the `medical_treatment_plan.sty` LaTeX package (in `assets/`), which provides a color-coded clinical look with custom box environments (`infobox`, `warningbox`, `goalbox`, `keybox`, `emergencybox`, `patientinfo`) and styled medical tables.

For the full styling guide — color scheme, every box environment with examples, table formatting, compilation (XeLaTeX/PDFLaTeX), customization, installation, troubleshooting, and a worked styled-document example — see **[`references/latex_styling.md`](references/latex_styling.md)**.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Informed Consent**: All plans should involve patient understanding and voluntary agreement to proposed interventions.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect diverse cultural beliefs, health practices, and communication styles.
- **Health Equity**: Consider social determinants of health, access barriers, and disparities.
- **Privacy Protection**: Maintain strict HIPAA compliance; de-identify all protected health information in shared documents.
- **Autonomy and Beneficence**: Balance medical recommendations with patient autonomy and values while promoting patient welfare.
