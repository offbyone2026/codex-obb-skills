# PubChem Database

## Overview

PubChem is the world's largest freely available chemical database — 119M+ compounds, 322M+
substances, and 295M+ bioactivities per the PubChem 2025 update (Kim et al., NAR 2025). Query chemical structures by name, CID, or SMILES, retrieve molecular
properties, perform similarity and substructure searches, and access bioactivity data using
the PUG-REST API and PubChemPy.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Searching for chemical compounds by name, structure (SMILES/InChI), or molecular formula
- Retrieving molecular properties (MW, LogP, TPSA, hydrogen bonding descriptors)
- Performing similarity searches to find structurally related compounds
- Conducting substructure searches for specific chemical motifs
- Accessing bioactivity data from screening assays
- Converting between chemical identifier formats (CID, SMILES, InChI)
- Batch processing multiple compounds for drug-likeness screening or property analysis

### Does NOT Trigger

| Scenario | Use Instead |
|----------|-------------|
| Curated potency data (IC50/Ki) for targets and medicinal-chemistry series | `alterlab-chembl` |
| Computing descriptors or fingerprints on your own molecules locally | `alterlab-rdkit` |
| Human metabolite concentrations, biofluids, biomarker evidence | `alterlab-hmdb` |
| Drug pharmacology, interactions, and approval details | `alterlab-drugbank` |
| Purchasable compound libraries for virtual screening | `alterlab-zinc-db` |

## Core Capabilities

PubChem access is organized into nine capability areas. Copy-ready snippets for each live in
`references/capabilities.md`.

1. **Chemical structure search** — by name, CID, SMILES, InChI, or molecular formula.
2. **Property retrieval** — single, specific-list, or batch molecular properties.
3. **Similarity search** — Tanimoto similarity with threshold/MaxRecords.
4. **Substructure search** — find compounds containing a structural motif.
5. **Format conversion** — CID/SMILES/InChI/InChIKey and structure-file download.
6. **Structure visualization** — 2D PNG images via PubChemPy or direct URL.
7. **Synonym retrieval** — all known names for a compound.
8. **Bioactivity data access** — assay summaries via PUG-REST and helper script.
9. **Comprehensive annotations** — full PUG-View records (properties, drug info, safety, toxicity).

## Core Workflow

The canonical entry point resolves an identifier to a compound, then reads properties:

```python
import pubchempy as pcp

compound = pcp.get_compounds('aspirin', 'name')[0]
print(compound.cid, compound.molecular_formula, compound.molecular_weight)
print(compound.smiles, compound.xlogp, compound.tpsa)
```

Prefer CIDs for repeated queries (more efficient than names/structures). Similarity and
substructure searches run asynchronously and may take 15-30 seconds; PubChemPy polls
automatically. PUG-REST answers HTTP 503 (`PUGREST.ServerBusy`) both when you exceed the
limits and when PubChem itself is overloaded — read the `X-Throttling-Control` response
header and back off rather than retrying immediately. See `references/best_practices.md`
for rate limits and error handling.

## Installation Requirements

```bash
uv pip install 'pubchempy>=1.0.5'  # Python-based access (1.0.5 = current SMILES property names)
uv pip install requests            # direct API / bioactivity queries
uv pip install pandas              # optional, for data analysis
```

**SMILES property naming (PubChem changed this in 2025):** the PUG-REST `CanonicalSMILES`
and `IsomericSMILES` properties are deprecated. Use `SMILES` (full SMILES with
stereo/isotope info, replaces `IsomericSMILES`) and `ConnectivitySMILES` (connectivity-only,
replaces `CanonicalSMILES`). In PubChemPy 1.0.5 the matching Compound attributes are
`compound.smiles` and `compound.connectivity_smiles` (the old `canonical_smiles` /
`isomeric_smiles` attributes still resolve but are deprecated).

## Helper Scripts

This skill ships two Python helper scripts under `scripts/`:

- `scripts/compound_search.py` — search, property retrieval, similarity/substructure search,
  synonyms, batch search, and structure download.
- `scripts/bioactivity_query.py` — bioassay summaries, target identification, target-based
  compound search, and PUG-View annotations.

Full function inventories and usage are in `references/helper_scripts.md`.
