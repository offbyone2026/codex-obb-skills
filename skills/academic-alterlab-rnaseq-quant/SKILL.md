description: Quantifies bulk RNA-seq transcript abundance with salmon 2.x (the Rust rewrite; selective alignment or --sketch) and kallisto (v0.52.0, kb-python workflow), builds a decoy-aware gentrome index, runs quant with --gcBias -l A, then imports estimates via tximport/tximeta with a tx2gene map and hands differential expression to alterlab-pydeseq2. Warns that salmon 2.0 cannot read C++/pufferfish indices (rebuild every index), that --validateMappings is now accepted-but-ignored, and that 'salmon alevin' was REMOVED (single-cell now uses piscem + alevin-fry). Use when quantifying RNA-seq transcript abundance, running salmon or kallisto, building a decoy-aware index, or wiring tximport to DESeq2; for differential expression use alterlab-pydeseq2, for FASTQ-to-VCF variant calling use alterlab-nf-core-sarek.

# RNA-seq Quantification — salmon & kallisto Transcript Abundance

The command-line quantification entry point for bulk RNA-seq: take raw FASTQ
reads plus a reference transcriptome and produce transcript-level abundance
estimates (counts + TPM) with **salmon** (selective alignment) or **kallisto**
(pseudoalignment via kb-python), then aggregate to the gene level with
`tximport`/`tximeta` and hand off to `alterlab-pydeseq2` for differential
expression. It is the raw-data-to-count-matrix pipeline that the repo's Python
analysis skills assume already ran.

## Quick Start

```
Quantify these RNA-seq FASTQs with salmon and a decoy-aware index
Build a salmon gentrome index from this transcriptome + genome
Run kallisto / kb count on my paired-end reads
Turn my salmon quant.sf files into a gene-level count matrix for DESeq2
```

→ Build a **decoy-aware** index once, run `salmon quant` (or `kb count`) per
sample, then run `scripts/build_tx2gene.py` + `scripts/import_quant.py` to make
the `tximport` gene matrix and route it to `alterlab-pydeseq2`.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the request is about **getting from FASTQ to transcript or
gene abundance** with a lightweight quantifier:

- "Quantify my RNA-seq with salmon / kallisto."
- "Build a decoy-aware salmon index (gentrome + decoys.txt)."
- "Run selective alignment with `--gcBias`." / "Use salmon's `--sketch` mode."
- "I have `quant.sf` files — make me a gene-level count matrix for DESeq2."
- "Set up `tximport` / `tximeta` with a tx2gene map."
- "Use kb-python / `kb count` to pseudoalign these reads."

### Does NOT Trigger — route these to the right sibling

| The request is really about… | Route to |
|------------------------------|----------|
| Differential expression on a **count matrix** (DESeq2 Wald tests, FDR, volcano) | `alterlab-pydeseq2` |
| **Single-cell** RNA-seq quantification (was `salmon alevin`) | piscem + alevin-fry — see [references/single_cell_alevin.md](references/single_cell_alevin.md); downstream → `alterlab-scanpy` / `alterlab-scvi-tools` |
| **FASTQ-to-VCF** germline/somatic variant calling | `alterlab-nf-core-sarek` |
| **16S/ITS amplicon** (microbiome) FASTQ-to-feature-table | `alterlab-qiime2-amplicon` |
| **Spatial** transcriptomics (Visium/Xenium) neighborhood analysis | `alterlab-squidpy-spatial` |
| Loading/manipulating the resulting matrix as an **AnnData** object | `alterlab-anndata` |
| BLAST/DIAMOND **sequence similarity search** | `alterlab-blast` |
| Quick gene/transcript **ID lookups & reference fetch** (Ensembl/RefSeq) | `alterlab-gget` |
| Aligned **BAM** manipulation, coverage, read counting from alignments | `alterlab-pysam` |

This skill stops at the **count/abundance matrix**. It does not call DEGs, does
not handle single-cell barcodes, and does not align to a genome for variant
calling.

## Two Critical Correctness Traps (read before quantifying)

These are the three failures most outdated RNA-seq instructions get wrong now that
salmon has moved to **2.x** (a from-scratch Rust rewrite; bioconda 2.7.0). All are
confirmed in the upstream `MIGRATION.md` (see
[references/tool_versions.md](references/tool_versions.md)).

1. **salmon 2.0 cannot read a C++ (pufferfish) index.** The index format changed
   with the rewrite. Loading an old index — or pointing old salmon at a 2.x index —
   is detected and rejected with a clear error, so this fails loudly rather than
   silently. **Rebuild every index** with the same salmon version you quantify with.
   `quant.sf` and the bootstrap/Gibbs outputs are unchanged, so tximport, tximeta,
   fishpond and swish keep working on 2.x output with no changes.

2. **`--validateMappings` no longer does anything.** Selective alignment is the
   default (and only) alignment mode in 2.x, so the flag parses and logs a warning.
   Copying it from a 2019-era tutorial is harmless but misleading; drop it. Several
   other C++ flags now **error out**: `--mimicBT2`, `--mimicStrictBT2`,
   `--minAssignedFrags`, `--numBiasSamples`, `--alternativeInitMode`.

3. **`salmon alevin` was REMOVED.** Single-cell quantification is no longer part of
   salmon; `salmon alevin …` prints a redirect and exits. Use the
   **piscem + alevin-fry** ecosystem instead. If the user has single-cell / droplet
   data, route per the table above and see
   [references/single_cell_alevin.md](references/single_cell_alevin.md).

If you genuinely need the old behavior, the final C++ release (salmon 1.12.0) lives
on the upstream `cpp` branch and is packaged separately as `salmon-cpp`.

---

## Pipeline (salmon, the default path)

### 1. Build a decoy-aware gentrome index (once per reference)

A **decoy-aware** index lets salmon distinguish reads that align better to the
genome than the transcriptome, reducing spurious assignments. You build a
"gentrome" = transcripts FASTA **concatenated with the genome FASTA**, plus a
`decoys.txt` listing the genome sequence names as decoys.

```bash
# 1. decoys.txt = the genome's sequence (chromosome) names, one per line
grep "^>" genome.fa | sed 's/^>//; s/ .*//' > decoys.txt

# 2. gentrome = transcripts FIRST, then genome (order matters)
cat transcripts.fa genome.fa > gentrome.fa

# 3. build the index (rebuild under salmon 2.x — see trap #1)
salmon index \
  -t gentrome.fa \
  -d decoys.txt \
  -i salmon_index \
  -k 31 \
  -p 8
```

- `-k 31` is the default k-mer; lower it only for very short reads.
- The helper `scripts/make_decoys.py` writes `decoys.txt` and `gentrome.fa` for
  you and refuses to proceed if the genome names are absent from the transcript
  FASTA (a common silent mistake). See [references/decoy_index.md](references/decoy_index.md).

### 2. Quantify each sample

```bash
salmon quant \
  -i salmon_index \
  -l A \
  -1 sampleA_R1.fastq.gz -2 sampleA_R2.fastq.gz \
  --gcBias \
  -p 8 \
  -o quants/sampleA
```

- **`-l A`** — auto-detect library type (strandedness). Let salmon infer it
  unless you have a documented protocol; verify the inferred type in
  `lib_format_counts.json`.
- **Selective alignment is the default** in salmon 2.x — there is no flag to turn
  it on (`--validateMappings` is accepted and ignored). `--sketch` opts *out* of it
  into faster alignment-free pseudoalignment; prefer the default when the
  quantification feeds differential expression, and reserve `--sketch` for very
  large screens where speed dominates.
- **`--gcBias`** — corrects fragment-level GC bias; recommended for DE and cheap
  to enable. Add `--seqBias` for 5'/3' sequence-specific bias if needed.
- **`--ignoreTxVersion`** (new in 2.x) — with `-g/--geneMap`, matches transcript
  IDs ignoring the trailing `.N`, the way tximport's option of the same name does.
  Needed for an Ensembl cDNA index against an Ensembl GTF. When transcripts fail to
  match the gene map, 2.x writes the offending names to
  `aux_info/genemap_unmatched_txps.json` and warns once with a count, instead of
  C++ salmon's one warning per transcript — check for that file after any run that
  used `-g`.
- For single-end reads, pass `-r reads.fastq.gz` instead of `-1/-2`.

Each sample produces `quants/<sample>/quant.sf` (transcript-level estimates) and
`quants/<sample>/lib_format_counts.json` (the inferred library type). See
[references/salmon_quant.md](references/salmon_quant.md) for the full flag map
and per-sample QC checks.

### 3. Aggregate to gene level with tximport

Build a transcript→gene map (`tx2gene`) from your annotation, then summarize the
per-sample `quant.sf` files into a gene-level matrix that `pydeseq2` consumes.

```bash
# tx2gene from a GTF/GFF3 (transcript_id -> gene_id)
uv run python scripts/build_tx2gene.py annotation.gtf --out tx2gene.tsv

# import + summarize to gene level (tximport "lengthScaledTPM" counts)
uv run python scripts/import_quant.py \
  --quants quants \
  --tx2gene tx2gene.tsv \
  --out-counts gene_counts.tsv \
  --out-tpm gene_tpm.tsv
```

`import_quant.py` produces an integer-rounded gene × sample count matrix plus a
gene × sample TPM matrix, the inputs `alterlab-pydeseq2` expects. It implements
tximport's `makeCountsFromAbundance(..., "lengthScaledTPM")` at the transcript
level (scale each transcript's TPM by its sample-averaged effective length, then
rescale each sample column back to its mapped-read library size) and sums to
genes — so the counts are length-corrected and library-size-scaled, **not** raw
summed `NumReads`. The canonical R route is the `tximport` / `tximeta`
Bioconductor packages with `countsFromAbundance = "lengthScaledTPM"`; the Python
helper here reproduces that computation so you can stay in `uv` (differing only
in integer rounding and the absence of `tximeta` provenance). See
[references/tximport_handoff.md](references/tximport_handoff.md) for the exact
semantics, the `tximeta` linkedTxome metadata option, and when to prefer the R
path.

### 4. Hand off to differential expression

Pass `gene_counts.tsv` (+ a sample/condition sheet) to **`alterlab-pydeseq2`**.
This skill does not call DEGs — that is pydeseq2's job (size-factor
normalization, dispersion, Wald tests, BH-FDR, volcano/MA plots).

---

## Pipeline (kallisto, the pseudoalignment path)

`kallisto` (standalone **v0.52.0**) and the **kb-python** wrapper (`kb`) give a
faster pseudoalignment route. kb-python drives `kallisto | bustools` and writes
tidy outputs.

```bash
# build a kallisto index from the transcriptome
kallisto index -i kallisto_index.idx transcripts.fa

# quantify a paired-end sample
kallisto quant -i kallisto_index.idx -o quants_kallisto/sampleA \
  sampleA_R1.fastq.gz sampleA_R2.fastq.gz

# OR the kb-python workflow (bulk)
# -f1 is the cDNA FASTA kb WRITES; trailing positionals are genome FASTA THEN GTF
kb ref -i index.idx -g t2g.txt -f1 cdna.fa genome.fa annotation.gtf
kb count -i index.idx -g t2g.txt -x bulk -o quants_kb/sampleA \
  sampleA_R1.fastq.gz sampleA_R2.fastq.gz
```

- kallisto outputs `abundance.tsv` / `abundance.h5`; feed these to `tximport`
  (`type="kallisto"`) the same way as salmon's `quant.sf`.
- **Long reads:** kb-python exposes **lr-kallisto** via the `--long` flag (and
  `k>31` k-mers) — use it for ONT/PacBio cDNA. See
  [references/kallisto_kb.md](references/kallisto_kb.md).
- kallisto does not use the decoy/gentrome construction; that is salmon-specific.

---

## Turnkey alternative — nf-core/rnaseq

For an end-to-end, provenance-tracked pipeline (trimming → alignment →
quantification → QC), **nf-core/rnaseq v3.26.0** runs `--aligner star_salmon` by
default: STAR maps to the genome, projects onto the transcriptome, and Salmon
does the quantification. Reach for it when the user wants a reproducible
Nextflow pipeline rather than hand-run commands; this skill covers the
direct-salmon/kallisto path and the tximport handoff. See
[references/tool_versions.md](references/tool_versions.md).

---

## Offload note

Indexing and per-sample quantification are CPU/IO-heavy but fully offline. On a
local workstation these are good candidates to run directly (e.g. overnight)
rather than streaming large FASTQs through an API session. Build the index once;
quantify samples in a loop.

---

## Self-Check Before Reporting

- Did you **rebuild** the salmon index with the same 2.x binary you quantified with
  (trap #1)? A C++/pufferfish index is rejected outright.
- Is the index **decoy-aware** (gentrome + `decoys.txt`) for salmon? Confirm the
  genome names made it into `decoys.txt`.
- Did you let `-l A` infer strandedness, and did you sanity-check the inferred
  type in `lib_format_counts.json`?
- Is the data actually **single-cell**? If so you must NOT use this path —
  `salmon alevin` is gone; route to piscem + alevin-fry (trap #2).
- Did you stop at the **count matrix** and hand DE off to `alterlab-pydeseq2`
  rather than calling DEGs here?
