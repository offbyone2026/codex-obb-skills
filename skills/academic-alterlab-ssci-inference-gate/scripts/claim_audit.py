"""Claim linter: flag inferential overreach against the Design Passport (stdlib only).

Reads the study's facts (design, whether the identifying assumption is defended, sample type) and
a draft claim sentence, then flags three kinds of overreach:

  1. causal language not licensed by the design,
  2. population generalization from a non-probability sample,
  3. common p-value / confidence-interval misreadings.

It does NOT rewrite for you and it does NOT judge substance — it surfaces sentences to audit.

        --sample non-probability --claim "Remote work increases satisfaction among adults."
