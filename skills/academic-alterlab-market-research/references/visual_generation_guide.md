# Visual Generation Guide for Market Research Reports

Complete prompts and guidance for generating visualizations in market research reports.

---

## Overview

This guide provides ready-to-use prompts for visuals that can strengthen a market research report. Figures are optional — choose the ones that genuinely clarify market structure, scale, competition, or risk. Hand conceptual prompts to the **alterlab-scientific-schematics** skill (diagrams, matrices, timelines) or the **alterlab-generate-image** skill (cover art, conceptual illustrations).

**Plot data charts; do not generate them.** Entries marked **Tool: plot** encode numbers (market size, shares, CAGR, projections). Build them with **alterlab-matplotlib** or **alterlab-plotly** from the sourced data table, treating the prompt text as the figure specification, and check them with **alterlab-figure-qa**. Image-generation models fabricate bar heights, labels, and axis values, so they must not draw these.

### Foundational Visuals

These often anchor a report's analytical framework:

1. **Market Growth Trajectory Chart** - Shows market size trends
2. **TAM/SAM/SOM Diagram** - Market opportunity breakdown
3. **Porter's Five Forces** - Competitive dynamics framework
4. **Competitive Positioning Matrix** - Strategic positioning
5. **Risk Heatmap** - Risk assessment visualization
6. **Executive Summary Infographic** - Report overview

### Additional Visuals

These can help when specific sections call for visual support:
- Regional breakdown charts
- Segment analysis
- Customer journey maps
- Technology roadmaps
- Regulatory timelines
- Financial projections
- Implementation timelines

### Tool Selection

| Visual Type | Tool | Rationale |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| Data charts (bar, line, pie, treemap, projections) | alterlab-matplotlib / alterlab-plotly | Values must come from the sourced data table |
| Diagrams (flow, structure) | scientific-schematics | Clear technical layouts |
| Matrices (2x2, positioning) | scientific-schematics | Strategic frameworks |
| Timelines | scientific-schematics | Sequential information |
| Infographics | generate-image (numbers typed in from verified sources, then proofread) | Creative visual synthesis |
| Conceptual illustrations | generate-image | Abstract concepts |
