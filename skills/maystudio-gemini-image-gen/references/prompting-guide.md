## Five Prompting Frameworks

---

### Framework 1: Image Generation

#### Text-to-Image (without references)

**Formula:** `[Subject] + [Action] + [Location/Context] + [Composition] + [Style]`

**Example:**
> [Subject] A striking fashion model wearing a tailored brown dress, sleek boots, and holding a structured handbag. [Action] Posing with a confident, statuesque stance, slightly turned. [Location/context] A seamless, deep cherry red studio backdrop. [Composition] Medium-full shot, center-framed. [Style] Fashion magazine style editorial, shot on medium-format analog film, pronounced grain, high saturation, cinematic lighting effect.

#### Multimodal Generation (with references)

**Formula:** `[Reference images] + [Relationship instruction] + [New scenario]`

Use for maintaining character consistency and merging products into new environments.

**Example:**
> Using the attached napkin sketch as the structural layout and the attached fabric sample as the surface texture, transform this into a high-fidelity 3D render of a modern armchair placed in a Scandinavian-style living room.

---

### Framework 2: Image Editing

#### Conversational Editing (without new references)

**Semantic masking (inpainting):** Define a "mask" through text to edit a specific part of an image.

- Be explicit about what to keep exactly the same
- Example: "Remove the man from the photo, keeping the background and lighting identical"

#### Composition and Style Transfer (with new references)

**Adding elements:**
- Upload a base image and an object image
- Tell the model to combine them
- Example: "Place this product on the desk in the base image"

**Style transfer:**
- Upload a photo and request a style change
- Example: "Recreate the exact content of this city street photo in the style of a Van Gogh painting"

---

### Framework 3: Real-Time Information from Web Search

The model can search the web for real-time data and use it in image generation.

**Formula:** `[Source/Search request] + [Analytical task] + [Visual translation]`

**Example:**
> Search for the current weather in San Francisco, then generate an image of the Golden Gate Bridge reflecting those exact weather conditions in a photorealistic style.

---

### Framework 4: Text Rendering and Localization

**Rules for best typographic results:**

1. **Use quotes:** Enclose desired text in quotes
   - Example: `"Happy Birthday"` or `"URBAN EXPLORER"`

2. **Choose a font:** Describe the typography style or name
   - Examples: "bold, white, sans-serif font" or "Century Gothic 12px font"

3. **Translate and localize:** Write in one language, specify target language
   - Supports 10+ languages

**Text-first hack:** First converse to generate text concepts, then request the image with that text.

**Example prompts:**
> A high-end, glossy commercial beauty shot of a sleek, minimalist nude-colored face moisturizer jar resting on a warm studio background. The lighting is soft and radiant. Next to the product, render three lines of text with the following exact styling: For the top line, the word "GLOW" in a flowing, elegant Brush Script font. For the middle line, the text "10% OFF" in a heavy, blocky Impact font. For the bottom line, the text "Your First Order" in a thin, minimalist Century Gothic font.

> A typographic poster with a solid black background, bold letters spell "New York", filling the center of the frame. The text acts as a cut-out window. A photograph of the New York skyline is visible ONLY inside the letterforms.

### Framework 5: Prompting Like a Creative Director

#### 1. Design Your Lighting

| Lighting Type | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| Three-point softbox setup | Even, professional product lighting |
| Chiaroscuro (harsh, high contrast) | Dramatic, moody, artistic |
| Golden hour backlighting | Warm, long shadows, romantic |
| Rembrandt lighting | Portrait classic, triangle shadow on cheek |
| Ring light | Beauty, fashion, even face lighting |
| Neon / colored gels | Cyberpunk, editorial, modern |

#### 2. Choose Camera, Lens, and Focus

| Camera/Lens | Visual Effect |
|-------------|--------------|
| GoPro | Immersive, distorted, action feel |
| Fujifilm | Authentic color science, film-like |
| Cheap disposable camera | Raw, nostalgic flash aesthetic |
| Low-angle, shallow DOF (f/1.8) | Subject isolation, dramatic perspective |
| Wide-angle lens | Vast scale, environmental shots |
| Macro lens | Intricate details, close-up textures |
| Telephoto (200mm) | Compressed background, portrait isolation |
| Tilt-shift | Miniature effect, selective focus |

#### 3. Define Color Grading and Film Stock

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1980s color film, slightly grainy | Nostalgic, gritty, retro |
| Cinematic muted teal tones | Modern, moody, cinematic |
| High saturation editorial | Vibrant, fashion magazine |
| Kodak Portra 400 | Warm skin tones, soft pastels |
| Fuji Velvia 50 | Hyper-saturated landscapes |
| Black and white, high contrast | Dramatic, timeless |
| Cross-processed | Unexpected color shifts, experimental |

#### 4. Emphasize Materiality and Texture

Instead of generic descriptions, specify exact materials:

| Generic | Enhanced |
|---------|----------|
| "suit jacket" | "navy blue tweed suit jacket with visible herringbone weave" |
| "armor" | "ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns" |
| "coffee mug" | "minimalist ceramic coffee mug with a matte sage green glaze" |
| "wall" | "exposed brick wall with peeling whitewash and moss growth" |
| "floor" | "polished white marble floor with subtle grey veining" |

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Be specific** -- Provide concrete details on subject, lighting, and composition
2. **Use positive framing** -- Describe what you want, not what you don't want ("empty street" instead of "no cars")
3. **Control the camera** -- Use photographic/cinematic terms like "low angle" and "aerial view"
4. **Iterate** -- Refine images with follow-up prompts in the same conversation
5. **Start with a strong verb** -- Begin prompts with a verb describing the primary operation
6. **Describe narratively** -- Write scene descriptions, not keyword lists
7. **Specify resolution and aspect ratio** -- Include these in the prompt text naturally
8. **Use reference images strategically** -- Combine up to 14 references for character consistency, style transfer, or composition
