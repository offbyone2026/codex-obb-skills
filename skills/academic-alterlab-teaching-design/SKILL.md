# Teaching Design — Course & Curriculum Design Agent

A comprehensive teaching design tool for faculty at all career stages. Covers the full course design lifecycle: from articulating learning outcomes through backward design, to constructing aligned assessments, building rubrics, drafting syllabi, and planning individual lessons. Supports face-to-face, online, and hybrid modalities with inclusive pedagogy principles throughout.

## Overview

Teaching design is the systematic process of creating educational experiences that lead to measurable learning. This skill guides faculty through evidence-based frameworks for course design, helping transform disciplinary expertise into effective, equitable, and engaging learning experiences.

The skill integrates three foundational frameworks:
1. **Backward Design** (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005) — Start with desired results, then determine acceptable evidence, then plan learning experiences
2. **Constructive Alignment** (Biggs et al., 2022) — Align intended learning outcomes, teaching/learning activities, and assessment tasks
3. **Bloom's Revised Taxonomy** (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001) — Classify cognitive complexity of learning outcomes across six levels

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Designing a new course from scratch
- Redesigning or revising an existing course
- Writing or refining learning outcomes and objectives
- Creating assessment instruments (exams, projects, portfolios)
- Building rubrics for grading consistency
- Drafting or updating a course syllabus
- Planning individual class sessions or lesson sequences
- Transitioning a face-to-face course to online or hybrid format
- Conducting curriculum mapping across a program
- Implementing inclusive and accessible pedagogy
- Preparing course-level evidence for accreditation reviews
- Mentoring junior faculty on teaching practices

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Learning Outcome Design with Bloom's Taxonomy

Learning outcomes are the foundation of all course design. Every outcome should be specific, measurable, and aligned to an appropriate cognitive level.

**Bloom's Revised Taxonomy — Six Cognitive Levels:**

| Level | Category | Key Verbs | Example Outcome |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Remember | Define, list, recall, identify, name | List the five principles of effective survey design |
| 2 | Understand | Explain, summarize, paraphrase, classify | Explain the difference between formative and summative assessment |
| 3 | Apply | Implement, use, execute, demonstrate | Apply backward design to create a course module |
| 4 | Analyze | Differentiate, organize, compare, deconstruct | Analyze alignment between outcomes, activities, and assessments in a syllabus |
| 5 | Evaluate | Judge, critique, justify, appraise | Evaluate the validity of a rubric using inter-rater reliability data |
| 6 | Create | Design, construct, produce, formulate | Design an inclusive assessment strategy for a hybrid graduate seminar |

**ABCD Framework for Writing Outcomes:**

```
A — Audience:    Who is the learner? (e.g., "By the end of this course, students will...")
B — Behavior:    What will they do? (Use observable, measurable verbs)
C — Condition:   Under what conditions? (e.g., "Given a dataset...", "Without references...")
D — Degree:      To what standard? (e.g., "with 80% accuracy", "meeting APA 7 standards")
```

**Example — Well-Written vs. Poorly Written Outcomes:**

```
POOR:   "Students will understand research ethics."
         (Problem: "understand" is not observable or measurable)

BETTER: "Students will identify three ethical violations in a given research scenario
         and propose corrections consistent with the Belmont Report principles."
         (A: Students, B: identify and propose, C: given a scenario, D: consistent with Belmont)
```

**Outcome Mapping Template:**

```markdown
## Course: [Title]
## Program Learning Outcome Alignment

| Course Learning Outcome | Bloom's Level | Program Outcome | Assessment Method | Week(s) |
|------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| CLO1: [outcome text]   | Apply (3)     | PLO2            | Project Phase 1   | 4-6     |
| CLO2: [outcome text]   | Analyze (4)   | PLO3            | Case Study Report | 8-10    |
| CLO3: [outcome text]   | Evaluate (5)  | PLO5            | Peer Review       | 12-14   |
| CLO4: [outcome text]   | Create (6)    | PLO1, PLO4      | Final Portfolio   | 15-16   |
```

### 2. Backward Design Process

Backward design inverts the traditional approach of starting with content and ending with a test. Instead, it begins with the end in mind.

**Stage 1 — Identify Desired Results**

Ask:
- What should students know, understand, and be able to do?
- What enduring understandings should they retain years later?
- What essential questions will guide inquiry?

```markdown
## Desired Results Template

### Established Goals
- [Institutional/program goals this course addresses]

### Enduring Understandings
Students will understand that...
1. [Big idea that transcends the course]
2. [Transferable principle]

### Essential Questions
1. [Open-ended question that provokes deep thinking]
2. [Question that recurs throughout the course]

### Knowledge and Skills
Students will know...              Students will be able to...
- [Key facts/concepts]             - [Key skills/processes]
- [Vocabulary/definitions]         - [Procedures/techniques]
```

**Stage 2 — Determine Acceptable Evidence**

Ask:
- How will I know students have achieved the outcomes?
- What performances or products will demonstrate understanding?
- What criteria distinguish levels of quality?

```markdown
## Evidence Plan

| Learning Outcome | Assessment Type | Format | Weight | Timing |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| CLO1            | Summative       | Research proposal | 25% | Week 8 |
| CLO2            | Formative       | Weekly reflections | 10% | Ongoing |
| CLO3            | Summative       | Peer review exercise | 20% | Week 12 |
| CLO4            | Summative       | Final portfolio | 35% | Week 16 |
| CLO1-4          | Formative       | In-class activities | 10% | Ongoing |
```

**Stage 3 — Plan Learning Experiences (WHERETO)**

```
W — Where is the course headed? Help students see the big picture.
H — Hook students early. Engage curiosity with a provocative question or problem.
E — Equip students with knowledge, skills, and tools.
R — Rethink. Provide opportunities to revise and reflect.
E — Evaluate. Let students self-assess and get feedback.
T — Tailor. Differentiate for diverse learners.
O — Organize. Sequence for maximum coherence and engagement.
```

### 3. Constructive Alignment

Constructive alignment (Biggs et al., 2022) ensures that what you teach, how you teach it, and how you assess it are all pointing in the same direction.

**Alignment Audit Template:**

```markdown
## Alignment Check

| Learning Outcome | Teaching/Learning Activity | Assessment Task | Aligned? |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| CLO1: Analyze... | Case study discussions, worked examples | Case analysis report | Yes |
| CLO2: Create... | Lectures only | Multiple-choice exam | NO — misaligned |
```

**Common Misalignment Patterns:**

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Outcome says "create" but assessment is MCQ | Students memorize instead of producing | Replace with project-based assessment |
| Activities are passive but outcome requires application | Students cannot transfer to new contexts | Add active learning: problem sets, simulations |
| High-level outcomes but only low-level activities | Students plateau at remember/understand | Scaffold activities up Bloom's levels progressively |
| Assessment tests content not in outcomes | Students feel blindsided; grade disputes | Map every assessment item to a specific CLO |

### 4. Assessment Design

#### Formative Assessment (Assessment FOR Learning)

Purpose: Monitor learning in progress, provide feedback, adjust teaching.

**Techniques by Class Size:**

| Technique | Small (<30) | Medium (30-100) | Large (100+) | Digital? |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| Muddiest Point | Write on cards | Poll Everywhere | LMS poll | Yes |
| Think-Pair-Share | Verbal | With microphone | With clickers | Optional |
| Concept Maps | Paper, share in groups | Digital (Miro) | LMS submission | Yes |
| One-Minute Paper | End of class | End of class | LMS auto-collect | Yes |
| Exit Tickets | Paper slips | Google Form | LMS quiz | Yes |
| Peer Instruction | Clickers + discussion | Clickers + discussion | Clickers + discussion | Yes |
| Draft Submissions | Written feedback | Rubric + comments | Peer review + spot-check | Yes |

#### Summative Assessment (Assessment OF Learning)

Purpose: Evaluate achievement at the end of a learning period.

**Assessment Type Selection Guide:**

```
Does the outcome require PRODUCTION of an artifact?
├── Yes → Project, portfolio, paper, presentation, design
│         Does it require COLLABORATION?
│         ├── Yes → Group project with individual accountability
│         └── No  → Individual project with milestones
└── No  → Does the outcome require PERFORMANCE in real-time?
          ├── Yes → Oral exam, demonstration, simulation, practicum
          └── No  → Does it require ANALYSIS or JUDGMENT?
                    ├── Yes → Case study, essay, critique, problem set
                    └── No  → Selected-response (MCQ, matching, T/F)
                              Use ONLY for Remember/Understand outcomes
```

**Exam Blueprint Template:**

```markdown
## Exam Blueprint: [Course] Midterm

| Topic | Weight | CLO | Bloom's Level | # Items | Item Type |
|-------|--------|-----|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Topic A | 25% | CLO1 | Remember (1) | 10 | MCQ |
| Topic B | 30% | CLO2 | Apply (3) | 3 | Short answer |
| Topic C | 25% | CLO3 | Analyze (4) | 2 | Case analysis |
| Topic D | 20% | CLO4 | Evaluate (5) | 1 | Essay |
| **Total** | **100%** | | | **16** | |
```

### 5. Rubric Design

Rubrics communicate expectations and ensure grading consistency. Choose the format to match the grading context:

- **Analytic rubric** — separate criteria (thesis, evidence, analysis, writing) each scored across performance levels; best for detailed, defensible grading.
- **Holistic rubric** — a single letter-grade scale with a descriptor per band; best for fast, whole-work judgments.
- **Single-point rubric** — one column of proficiency criteria flanked by open "areas for growth" and "evidence of excellence" columns; best for feedback-rich, low-stakes contexts.

Full copy-paste-ready versions of all three rubric formats: see `references/course_design_templates.md`.

### 6. Syllabus Design

A syllabus serves as a learning contract, a course map, and a motivational document. A complete syllabus covers: instructor information, course description, learning outcomes, required materials, an assessment-and-grading table (component / weight / due / CLO), the grading scale, course policies (attendance, late work, integrity, technology, communication), accessibility and diversity/inclusion statements, and a weekly schedule.

Full copy-paste-ready syllabus template with every component and example tables: see `references/course_design_templates.md`.

### 7. Lesson Plan Design

A single-session lesson plan sequences a class period from opening hook through mini-lecture, active learning, whole-class debrief, and closing formative check. It also specifies session-level objectives (aligned to CLOs), pre-class preparation, a timed session-flow table, a contingency plan (stalled discussion / early finish / tech failure), and a post-session reflection.

Full copy-paste-ready single-session lesson plan template with a timed session-flow table: see `references/course_design_templates.md`.

### 8. Online and Hybrid Course Design

**Modality Comparison:**

| Feature | Face-to-Face | Hybrid/Blended | Fully Online (Sync) | Fully Online (Async) |
|---------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Interaction | Real-time, in-person | Mix of in-person and online | Real-time via video | Discussion boards, email |
| Flexibility | Low (fixed time/place) | Medium | Medium (fixed time) | High (any time) |
| Community building | Natural | Requires intentional design | Possible with effort | Challenging |
| Technology dependence | Low | Medium | High | High |
| Best for | Labs, discussions, performances | Blending lecture and application | Geographically distributed cohorts | Working professionals |

**Community of Inquiry Framework (Garrison, Anderson, Archer):** Meaningful online learning arises at the intersection of three presences — **social presence** (open communication, group cohesion, affective expression), **cognitive presence** (triggering, exploration, integration, resolution), and **teaching presence** (design/organization, facilitating discourse, direct instruction). The educational experience is shaped by setting climate, supporting discourse, and selecting content.

### 9. Inclusive Pedagogy

Inclusive teaching ensures that all students, regardless of background, identity, ability, or prior preparation, have equitable opportunities to learn.

**Universal Design for Learning (UDL Guidelines 3.0, CAST 2024) — Three Principles:**

| Principle | Guidelines (3.0) | Implementation Examples |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Design Multiple Means of Engagement** (the WHY of learning) | Welcoming interests & identities; sustaining effort & persistence; emotional capacity | Choice in assignment topics; varied assessment formats; relevance to diverse experiences |
| **Design Multiple Means of Representation** (the WHAT of learning) | Perception; language & symbols; building knowledge | Videos with captions; diagrams with alt text; glossaries; multiple examples from different contexts |
| **Design Multiple Means of Action & Expression** (the HOW of learning) | Interaction; expression & communication; strategy development | Write or record; individual or group; scaffolded milestones; flexible deadlines with structure |

Version 3.0 (July 2024) replaced 2.2's goal of "expert learners" with learner agency (purposeful & reflective, resourceful & authentic, strategic & action-oriented) and treats learners' identities as part of variability; confirm current checkpoint labels at udlguidelines.cast.org before quoting them.

**Inclusive Assessment Strategies:**

- Offer assessment menus: "Choose 3 of 5 options to demonstrate CLO2"
- Use specifications grading to reduce bias in subjective evaluation
- Provide exemplars of strong, adequate, and weak work
- Allow revision and resubmission on major assignments
- Build in low-stakes practice before high-stakes assessments
- Ensure exam questions do not rely on culturally specific knowledge unrelated to the learning outcome

**Addressing Diverse Prior Knowledge:**

```
Pre-assessment at course start
├── Diagnostic quiz (not graded) → Identify prerequisite gaps
├── Background knowledge survey → Understand student contexts
└── Skills inventory → Map incoming competencies

Differentiated support
├── Remedial resources for students below threshold
├── Challenge extensions for advanced students
└── Flexible pathways through core content
```

### 10. Curriculum Mapping

Curriculum mapping ensures coherence across an entire program of study.

**Program-Level Mapping Template:**

```markdown
## Program: [Degree Name]
## Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs)

| PLO | Description | Introduced (I) | Reinforced (R) | Mastered (M) |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PLO1 | [Description] | COURSE101 | COURSE201, COURSE301 | COURSE401 |
| PLO2 | [Description] | COURSE102 | COURSE202 | COURSE302, COURSE402 |
| PLO3 | [Description] | COURSE101 | COURSE301 | COURSE401 |

## Gap Analysis
- PLO4 is only addressed in one course — add reinforcement opportunity
- No course provides mastery-level assessment for PLO2 — revise capstone
- COURSE203 does not map to any PLO — justify or redesign
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Start with outcomes, not content.** Content is a means to an outcome, not the goal itself. Resist the urge to design around topics you want to cover.

2. **Align everything.** Use the alignment audit template regularly. If an assessment does not map to an outcome, either the assessment or the outcome is wrong.

3. **Use formative assessment frequently.** Do not wait until the midterm to discover students are lost. Check understanding every session.

4. **Design for the margins.** When you design for students with the greatest barriers (disability, language, prior knowledge gaps), you improve learning for everyone (curb-cut effect).

5. **Scaffold complexity.** Do not jump from Remember to Create. Build through Bloom's levels progressively across the semester.

6. **Make the implicit explicit.** State expectations clearly. Provide rubrics before assignments. Explain why activities matter. Share the course design rationale with students.

7. **Iterate based on evidence.** Use student feedback, grade distributions, and your own reflections to revise. Teaching design is never finished.

8. **Balance workload.** Use a course workload estimator to ensure total student hours are reasonable (rule of thumb: 2-3 hours outside class per credit hour per week).

9. **Build community.** Learning is social. Design activities that require meaningful interaction, not just parallel work.

10. **Document your design.** Keep a course design portfolio for tenure review, accreditation, and sharing with colleagues.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | How to Avoid |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Content overload | Faculty try to cover everything they know | Prioritize with backward design — cut what does not serve outcomes |
| Assessment pileup | Assignments accumulate without coordination | Map all due dates on a semester calendar; coordinate with colleagues |
| Misaligned assessments | Assessments inherited from previous instructor | Audit alignment annually; redesign assessments to match your outcomes |
| Vague rubrics | Written in a hurry without calibration | Pilot rubrics with colleagues; use student work samples to test criteria |
| Inaccessible materials | Default to PDF scans, image-heavy slides | Check accessibility before posting; use LMS accessibility checker |
| Ignoring student feedback | "Students don't know what's good for them" | Distinguish preference feedback from learning feedback; act on patterns |
| One-size-fits-all design | Single modality, single assessment type | Apply UDL principles; offer choices where possible |
| No low-stakes practice | Students' first attempt is the graded one | Add ungraded or low-weight practice before every major assessment |
| Isolation in design | Designing alone without peer input | Participate in teaching communities; invite a colleague to review your syllabus |
