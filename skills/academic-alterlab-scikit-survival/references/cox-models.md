# Cox Proportional Hazards Models

## Overview

Cox proportional hazards models are semi-parametric models that relate covariates to the time of an event. The hazard function for individual *i* is expressed as:

**h_i(t) = h_0(t) × exp(β^T x_i)**

where:
- h_0(t) is the baseline hazard function (unspecified)
- β is the vector of coefficients
- x_i is the covariate vector for individual *i*

The key assumption is that the hazard ratio between two individuals is constant over time (proportional hazards).

## CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis

Basic Cox proportional hazards model for survival analysis.

### When to Use
- Standard survival analysis with censored data
- Need interpretable coefficients (log hazard ratios)
- Proportional hazards assumption holds
- Dataset has relatively few features

### Key Parameters
- `alpha`: Regularization parameter (default: 0, no regularization)
- `ties`: Method for handling tied event times ('breslow' or 'efron')
- `n_iter`: Maximum number of iterations for optimization

### Example Usage
```python
from sksurv.linear_model import CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis
from sksurv.datasets import load_gbsg2
from sksurv.preprocessing import encode_categorical

# Load data (X has categorical columns such as 'horTh', 'menostat', 'tgrade';
# y's fields are ('cens', 'time') for this dataset)
X, y = load_gbsg2()
X = encode_categorical(X)

# Fit Cox model
estimator = CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis()
estimator.fit(X, y)

# Get coefficients (log hazard ratios). No standard errors or p-values are
# computed; use lifelines CoxPHFitter or statsmodels PHReg for inference.
coefficients = estimator.coef_

# Predict risk scores
risk_scores = estimator.predict(X)
```

## CoxnetSurvivalAnalysis

Cox model with elastic net penalty for feature selection and regularization.

### When to Use
- High-dimensional data (many features)
- Need automatic feature selection
- Want to handle multicollinearity
- Require sparse models

### Penalty Types
- **Ridge (L2)**: `CoxnetSurvivalAnalysis` requires `0 < l1_ratio ≤ 1`, so use
  `CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis(alpha=...)` (ridge-penalized Cox) or a very small `l1_ratio`
  - Shrinks all coefficients
  - Good when all features are relevant

- **Lasso (L1)**: l1_ratio=1.0
  - Performs feature selection (sets coefficients to zero)
  - Good for sparse models

- **Elastic Net**: 0 < l1_ratio < 1
  - Combination of L1 and L2
  - Balances feature selection and grouping

### Key Parameters
- `l1_ratio`: Balance between L1 and L2 penalty, in (0, 1] (1 = Lasso; values near 0 approach Ridge)
- `alpha_min_ratio`: Ratio of smallest to largest penalty in regularization path
- `n_alphas`: Number of alphas along regularization path
- `fit_baseline_model`: Whether to fit unpenalized baseline model

### Example Usage
```python
from sksurv.linear_model import CoxnetSurvivalAnalysis

# Fit with elastic net penalty
estimator = CoxnetSurvivalAnalysis(l1_ratio=0.5, alpha_min_ratio=0.01)
estimator.fit(X, y)

# Access regularization path: coef_ has shape (n_features, n_alphas),
# one column per penalty in alphas_ (there is no coef_path_ attribute)
alphas = estimator.alphas_
coefficients_path = estimator.coef_

# Predict with specific alpha
risk_scores = estimator.predict(X, alpha=0.1)
```

### Cross-Validation for Alpha Selection

The IPCW scorer wrappers WRAP the estimator (overriding its `.score()` method);
they are not passed to `scoring=`, and there is no `scoring='concordance_index_ipcw'`
string. Wrap the estimator, then prefix tuned params with `estimator__`.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sksurv.metrics import as_concordance_index_ipcw_scorer

# Wrap so .score() uses Uno's C-index; tau caps the IPCW evaluation horizon
wrapped = as_concordance_index_ipcw_scorer(
    CoxnetSurvivalAnalysis(), tau=y['time'].max()
)

# Note the estimator__ prefix on every tuned parameter
param_grid = {'estimator__l1_ratio': [0.1, 0.5, 0.9],
              'estimator__alpha_min_ratio': [0.01, 0.001]}

cv = GridSearchCV(wrapped, param_grid, cv=5)
cv.fit(X, y)

best_params = cv.best_params_
# Unwrap to reach the fitted Coxnet model: cv.best_estimator_.estimator_
```

## IPCRidge

Inverse probability of censoring weighted Ridge regression for accelerated failure time models.

### When to Use
- Prefer accelerated failure time (AFT) framework over proportional hazards
- Need to model how features accelerate/decelerate survival time
- High censoring rates
- Want regularization with Ridge penalty

### Key Difference from Cox Models
AFT models assume features multiply survival time by a constant factor, rather than multiplying the hazard rate. The model predicts log survival time directly.

### Example Usage
```python
from sksurv.linear_model import IPCRidge

# Fit IPCRidge model
estimator = IPCRidge(alpha=1.0)
estimator.fit(X, y)

# Predict log survival time
log_time = estimator.predict(X)
```

## Model Comparison and Selection

### Choosing Between Models

**Use CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis when:**
- Small to moderate number of features
- Want interpretable hazard ratios
- Standard survival analysis setting

**Use CoxnetSurvivalAnalysis when:**
- High-dimensional data (p >> n)
- Need feature selection
- Want to identify important predictors
- Presence of multicollinearity

**Use IPCRidge when:**
- AFT framework is more appropriate
- High censoring rates
- Want to model time directly rather than hazard

### Checking Proportional Hazards Assumption

The proportional hazards assumption should be verified using:
- Schoenfeld residuals
- Log-log survival plots
- Statistical tests (available in other packages like lifelines)

If violated, consider:
- Stratification by violating covariates
- Time-varying coefficients
- Alternative models (AFT, parametric models)

## Interpretation

### Cox Model Coefficients
- Positive coefficient: increased hazard (shorter survival)
- Negative coefficient: decreased hazard (longer survival)
- Hazard ratio = exp(β) for one-unit increase in covariate
- Example: β=0.693 → HR=2.0 (doubles the hazard)

### Risk Scores
- Higher risk score = higher risk of event = shorter expected survival
- Risk scores are relative; use survival functions for absolute predictions
