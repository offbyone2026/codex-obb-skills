# Pipeline — VO-anchored motion-graphic listicle

How `config.example.json` maps to the real production steps. This molecule ships a
**config + this map**, not a bundled runner: the worked example (Everself "doctor-educator"
listicle — an example, not the default) was produced by per-project drivers that live in
`clients/everself-hb/working/doctor-christopher-avatar/` (`voice/render_listicle_v2.py`,
`working/render_hf.py`, `working/grade_brolls_v4.py`, `working/build_master_v4.py`).

**Creative calls come from the recipe's `choices`** (asked of the user first; the demo's values are
examples only): `narrator` → `voice.mode`/`voice.voice_id`; `tone` → the script + the read;
`list_angle` → the script + `beats[]`; `visual_style` → `design.name`/`callout_style`/`accents`/
`background_tiles` (colours + fonts still from the brand kit); `music` → `music.prompt` (`none` = no bed). Reference those directly, or drive the whole run via
`video-orchestrator-with-control-plane`.

The steps run **in order** because each depends on the last: the VO sets the timeline (its
word-level timestamps), the word times anchor every beat reveal, the beats + B-roll seed the
render, the render + concat build the silent master, and assembly mixes the VO under the music
bed + burns the window-masked captions.

## 1. VO -> ElevenLabs clone/cast  (config: `voice`)  [PAID]

**Lock the VO FIRST — it sets the timeline.** `voice/render_listicle_v2.py` narrates the listicle
script with ElevenLabs `eleven_v3` — per `choices.narrator`, either a **cloned** voice (train from a
short reference sample of that real person, then narrate) or a **cast** `voice_id` that fits the
narrator + `choices.tone` — then `atempo` to the target pace (v3's speed
param is weak; use ffmpeg `atempo` for real time-stretch) -> `voice/vo-render.mp3`. The delivered VO
and its word-level timings, NOT the plan, set the timeline.

## 2. Transcribe -> Whisper word timings  (config: `voice.outputs.word_timings`)  [~$0.10]

Groq `whisper-large-v3` word-level on the RENDERED VO -> `working/whisper/words-flat.json` (a flat
list of `{word, start, end}`). Every beat reveal in step 3 anchors to a word time here. Whisper is
the right tool for SPOKEN VO word-level; script-window timing is only for SUNG audio (not this format).

## 3. Beats -> hyperframe authoring  (config: `design`, `beats[]`)

One HTML hyperframe per beat in ONE design system: `working/hyperframes-v4/beat-NN.html`, each
exposing `window.renderAt(t)` driven by the Web Animations API so a renderer can seek any frame.
Shared `working/hyperframes-v4/_shared.css` holds the design tokens (palette, type, alternating
`background_tiles`, decorative `accents`, the callout style — look from `choices.visual_style`; the
demo used glass pills) and `_shared.js` holds
`initRenderer` + `revealWords` + easing. Reveals fire at each beat's `anchor_word`/`anchor_t` from
`words-flat.json`. Alternate the background tile per beat for rhythm; keep numerals / body type /
accents / callouts CONSISTENT so N beats read as one designed reel. This is deterministic web motion
graphics — NOT i2v.

## 4. Breather windows -> source + trim + color-grade  (config: `broll[]`)

How many windows and where they land are taste calls (0..N, on support-sentence pauses). There is
**no free stock-footage source** — the old `build_pexels_beats.py` / media-proxy stock path was never
wired. Per window pick `source`: `brand-clip` (a real clip the brand supplied — best, free),
`ai-video` (`create-video-fal`, **PAID — gate it**; SCREEN-FREE people footage from the brand's own
world, matched to the spoken line), or `motion-graphic` (a free on-brand animated breather). Trim it,
then `working/grade_brolls_v4.py` color-grades it to the palette. Render B-roll
at fps 25 to match the beats. These are the ONLY windows where captions burn — on the motion-graphic
beats the on-screen type IS the caption.

## 5. Render + captions + assembly  (config: `render_engine`, `captions`, `music`, `audio_mix`)

- **Render (`render_hf.py`):** for each beat, Playwright loads the hyperframe, calls
  `window.renderAt(t)` per frame, screenshots it, and ffmpeg encodes -> a silent mp4 per beat. **ALL
  beats MUST share fps 25** — a mismatched-fps beat stutters at the concat seam.
- **Captions:** built from `words-flat.json`, kept **ONLY inside the B-roll windows**, 2-word chunks,
  closing a cue on any >0.4s word gap. The ASS `Format:` header MUST include a `Name` field — without
  it the leading-comma bug eats the first field and captions silently drop.
- **Assembly (`build_master_v4.py`):** concat all beats + B-roll windows (ffmpeg demuxer) ->
  `master-silent.mp4`, mix the VO (full) under a LOW ElevenLabs Music bed (~0.18 vol), composite the
  silent video + the mixed audio + burn the window-masked captions, loudnorm to -14 LUFS ->
  `finals/master.mp4` (1080×1920, 25fps, h264 crf18 + aac 192k, ~66s).

Re-cuts (new caption chunking, re-timed beats, swapped B-roll, a different music bed level) reuse the
existing VO / beats / B-roll and cost **$0** — only the VO clone/narration, the Whisper pass, the
music bed, and any AI breather clips spend.
