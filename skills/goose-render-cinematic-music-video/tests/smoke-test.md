# Smoke Test

Given the generated anthem (mp3 + word timestamps), one 35mm-look keyframe + one i2v clip per
tableau, and the anthem's word timings, `render-cinematic-music-video` assembles the master:
cut each clip to its beat window, hard-cut on the beat, build cinematic lower-third captions,
mux the anthem → 1080×1920 h264+aac (~28s).

Use any cast, setting and song style for the placeholder inputs — they are user choices, not
part of the format (the Hype and Vice demo is one example). Nothing in the assembly may assume
the demo's people, place, vocalist or accent words.

Pass when the assembly runs to a valid MP4 and:
- clips are cut to their beat windows and hard-cut on the beat (bar the hero match-cut);
- the one 35mm-film look pack holds across all N tableaux (a 3-act arc, live-action register);
- captions are cinematic serif lower-thirds synced to the anthem's own word timings;
- the sung anthem carries with no separate VO, loudnormed to −14 LUFS;
- **no paid call is made** — the anthem, keyframes, and clips come from the paid capabilities
  (create-music-elevenlabs / create-image-gpt-image-fal / create-video-fal); this assembly is $0
  and a re-cut reuses the existing assets.
