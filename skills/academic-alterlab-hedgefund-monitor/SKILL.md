# OFR Hedge Fund Monitor API

Free, open REST API from the U.S. Office of Financial Research (OFR) providing aggregated hedge fund time series data. No API key or registration required.

**Base URL:** `https://data.financialresearch.gov/hf/v1`

## When to Use This Skill

- Aggregate hedge-fund size, leverage, liquidity, counterparty, or stress-test statistics (SEC Form PF via OFR)
- CFTC Traders in Financial Futures positioning, FICC sponsored-repo volumes, or FRB SCOOS dealer-financing terms
- Systemic-risk or financial-stability research that needs these series as clean time series

### Does NOT Trigger

| Scenario | Use Instead |
|----------|-------------|
| A single filer's raw Form PF/13F/13D documents or holdings line by line | `alterlab-edgartools` |
| Treasury yields, Fed policy rates, or financial-conditions indices | `alterlab-fred` |
| Treasury debt, auctions, or Daily Treasury Statement cash balances | `alterlab-usfiscaldata` |
| Security prices or fund NAV/price histories | `alterlab-alpha-vantage` |

## Quick Start

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

BASE = "https://data.financialresearch.gov/hf/v1"

# List all available datasets
resp = requests.get(f"{BASE}/series/dataset")
datasets = resp.json()
# Returns: {"ficc": {...}, "fpf": {...}, "scoos": {...}, "tff": {...}}

# Search for series by keyword
resp = requests.get(f"{BASE}/metadata/search", params={"query": "*leverage*"})
results = resp.json()
# Each result: {mnemonic, dataset, field, value, type}

# Fetch a single time series
resp = requests.get(f"{BASE}/series/timeseries", params={
    "mnemonic": "FPF-STRATEGY_EQUITY_LEVERAGERATIO_GAVWMEAN",
    "start_date": "2015-01-01"
})
series = resp.json()  # [[date, value], ...]
df = pd.DataFrame(series, columns=["date", "value"])
df["date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date"])
```

**Mnemonics are exact — guessing fails.** The API rejects unknown identifiers with a plain
`Invalid mnemonic` string (HTTP 200, not JSON). Always discover real mnemonics via
`/metadata/search` or `/metadata/mnemonics` before requesting data. Note in particular that
there is **no** `FPF-ALLQHF_LEVERAGERATIO_*` series: aggregate leverage is published per
gross-asset cohort (see below), while the `GAVWMEAN`/`NAVWMEAN` asset-weighted leverage means
exist only at the strategy level.

## Authentication

None required. The API is fully open and free.

## Datasets

| Key | Dataset | Update Frequency |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| `fpf` | SEC Form PF — aggregated stats from qualifying hedge fund filings | Quarterly |
| `tff` | CFTC Traders in Financial Futures — futures market positioning | Monthly |
| `scoos` | FRB Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms | Quarterly |
| `ficc` | FICC Sponsored Repo Service Volumes | Daily |

> The `/series/dataset` index returns `long_name: "FormPF"` for every dataset (an upstream API
> label quirk); the real source names are above. Confirm a series' true cadence via
> `schedule/observation_frequency` in its metadata.

## Data Categories

The HFM organizes data into six categories (each downloadable as CSV):
- **size** — Hedge fund industry size (AUM, count of funds, net/gross assets)
- **leverage** — Leverage ratios, borrowing, gross notional exposure
- **counterparties** — Counterparty concentration, prime broker lending
- **liquidity** — Financing maturity, investor redemption terms, portfolio liquidity
- **complexity** — Open positions, strategy distribution, asset class exposure
- **risk_management** — Stress test results (CDS, equity, rates, FX scenarios)

## Core Endpoints

### Metadata

| Endpoint | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| List mnemonics | `GET /metadata/mnemonics` | All series identifiers |
| Query series info | `GET /metadata/query?mnemonic=` | Full metadata for one series |
| Search series | `GET /metadata/search?query=` | Text search with wildcards (`*`, `?`) |

### Series Data

| Endpoint | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Single timeseries | `GET /series/timeseries?mnemonic=` | Date/value pairs for one series |
| Full single | `GET /series/full?mnemonic=` | Data + metadata for one series |
| Multi full | `GET /series/multifull?mnemonics=A,B` | Data + metadata for multiple series |
| Dataset | `GET /series/dataset?dataset=fpf` | All series in a dataset |
| Category CSV | `GET /categories?category=leverage` | CSV download for a category (returned HTTP 502 when checked on 2026-09-23; fall back to `/series/multifull`) |
| Spread | `GET /calc/spread?x=MNE1&y=MNE2` | Difference between two series |

## Common Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `start_date` | Start date YYYY-MM-DD | `2020-01-01` |
| `end_date` | End date YYYY-MM-DD | `2024-12-31` |
| `periodicity` | Resample frequency | `Q`, `M`, `A`, `D`, `W` |
| `how` | Aggregation method | `last` (default), `first`, `mean`, `median`, `sum` |
| `remove_nulls` | Drop null values | `true` |
| `time_format` | Date format | `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) or `ms` (epoch ms) |

## Key FPF Mnemonic Patterns

Mnemonics follow the pattern `FPF-{SCOPE}_{METRIC}_{STAT}`:
- Scope: `ALLQHF` (all qualifying hedge funds), or a strategy such as `STRATEGY_CREDIT`,
  `STRATEGY_EQUITY`, `STRATEGY_MACRO`, `STRATEGY_RV` (relative value), `STRATEGY_FUTURES`, etc.
  ALLQHF leverage/cash metrics carry a gross-asset cohort segment: `GAVN10` (10 largest funds),
  `GAVN11TO50`, `GAVN51` (rest).
- Metrics: `GAV` (gross assets), `NAV` (net assets), `GNE` (gross notional exposure),
  `LEVERAGERATIO`, `CASHRATIO`, `COUNT`, plus stress-test scenarios (`CDSUP250BPS`, etc.)
- Stats: `SUM`, `AVERAGE` (equal-weighted, used for ALLQHF cohorts), `GAVWMEAN`/`NAVWMEAN`
  (asset-weighted, strategy-level only), `P5`, `P50`, `P95`, `PCTCHANGE`

```python
# Verified series examples (all return data as of 2026)
mnemonics = [
    "FPF-ALLQHF_GAVN10_LEVERAGERATIO_AVERAGE",    # 10 largest funds: leverage (equal-weighted)
    "FPF-STRATEGY_EQUITY_LEVERAGERATIO_GAVWMEAN", # Equity strategy: leverage (GAV-weighted)
    "FPF-ALLQHF_GAV_SUM",                         # All funds: gross assets (total $)
    "FPF-ALLQHF_NAV_SUM",                         # All funds: net assets (total $)
    "FPF-ALLQHF_GNE_SUM",                         # All funds: gross notional exposure
    "FICC-SPONSORED_REPO_VOL",                    # FICC: sponsored repo volume (daily)
]
```
