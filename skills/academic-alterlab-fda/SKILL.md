# FDA Database Access

## Overview

Access comprehensive FDA regulatory data through openFDA, the FDA's initiative to provide open APIs for public datasets. Query information about drugs, medical devices, foods, animal/veterinary products, and substances using Python with standardized interfaces.

**Key capabilities:**
- Query adverse events for drugs, devices, foods, and veterinary products
- Access product labeling, approvals, and regulatory submissions
- Monitor recalls and enforcement actions
- Look up National Drug Codes (NDC) and substance identifiers (UNII)
- Analyze device classifications and clearances (510k, PMA)
- Track drug shortages and supply issues
- Research chemical structures and substance relationships

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when working with:
- **Drug research**: Safety profiles, adverse events, labeling, approvals, shortages
- **Medical device surveillance**: Adverse events, recalls, 510(k) clearances, PMA approvals
- **Food safety**: Recalls, allergen tracking, adverse events, dietary supplements
- **Veterinary medicine**: Animal drug adverse events by species and breed
- **Chemical/substance data**: UNII lookup, CAS number mapping, molecular structures
- **Regulatory analysis**: Approval pathways, enforcement actions, compliance tracking
- **Pharmacovigilance**: Post-market surveillance, safety signal detection
- **Scientific research**: Drug interactions, comparative safety, epidemiological studies

### Does NOT Trigger

| Scenario | Use Instead |
|----------|-------------|
| Clinical trial registry records (NCT IDs, recruitment, eligibility) | `alterlab-clinicaltrials` |
| Curated drug–target / DDI knowledge from DrugBank | `alterlab-drugbank` |
| Compound bioactivity and mechanism data | `alterlab-chembl` |
| Pharmacogenomic dosing guidance (CPIC/DPWG) | `alterlab-clinpgx` |

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Setup

```python
# Run from the skill's scripts/ dir, or add it to sys.path first.
from fda_query import FDAQuery

# API key is optional (works keyless); pass it or set FDA_API_KEY.
fda = FDAQuery(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Query drug adverse events
events = fda.query_drug_events("aspirin", limit=100)

# Get drug labeling
label = fda.query_drug_label("Lipitor", brand=True)

# Search device recalls
recalls = fda.query("device", "enforcement",
                   search="classification:Class+I",
                   limit=50)
```

### 2. API Key Setup

While the API works without a key, registering provides higher rate limits:
- **Without key**: 240 requests/min, 1,000/day
- **With key**: 240 requests/min, 120,000/day

Register at: https://open.fda.gov/apis/authentication/

Set as environment variable:
```bash
export FDA_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

### 3. Running Examples

```bash
# Run comprehensive examples
python scripts/fda_examples.py

# This demonstrates:
# - Drug safety profiles
# - Device surveillance
# - Food recall monitoring
# - Substance lookup
# - Comparative drug analysis

```

## FDA Database Categories

### Drugs

Access 6 drug-related endpoints covering the full drug lifecycle from approval to post-market surveillance.

**Endpoints:**
1. **Adverse Events** - Reports of side effects, errors, and therapeutic failures
2. **Product Labeling** - Prescribing information, warnings, indications
3. **NDC Directory** - National Drug Code product information
4. **Enforcement Reports** - Drug recalls and safety actions
5. **Drugs@FDA** - Historical approval data since 1939
6. **Drug Shortages** - Current and resolved supply issues

**Common use cases:**
```python
# Safety signal detection
fda.count_by_field("drug", "event",
                  search="patient.drug.medicinalproduct:metformin",
                  field="patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt")

# Get prescribing information
label = fda.query_drug_label("Keytruda", brand=True)

# Check for recalls
recalls = fda.query_drug_recalls(drug_name="metformin")

# Monitor shortages (endpoint is drug/shortages; status values:
# "Current", "To Be Discontinued", "Resolved")
shortages = fda.query("drug", "shortages",
                     search="status:Current")
```

```

**Reference:** See `references/other.md` for detailed documentation

## Query Patterns & Result Handling

Reusable `FDAQuery` patterns (safety profiles, temporal trends, comparative and
cross-database lookups), the response structure, error handling, pagination, and
best practices live in `references/query_patterns.md`.

Essentials to keep in mind:
- Use **specific field searches** (`patient.drug.medicinalproduct:aspirin`), not
  bare wildcards.
- `FDAQuery` handles rate limiting (240/min, 120,000/day with key) and caching
  automatically.
- `skip` is capped at 25,000 (`query_all` stops there); page deeper via the
  `search_after` cursor in the `Link` response header, narrower date-range searches,
  or the bulk downloads. `meta.last_updated` tells you how fresh each endpoint is —
  FAERS (`drug/event`) lags by a quarter.
- Use `exact=True` on `count_by_field` to count exact phrases (adds `.exact`).
- All responses share the `{meta: {results: {total, ...}}, results: [...]}` shape;
  always check for `error` and empty `results`.
