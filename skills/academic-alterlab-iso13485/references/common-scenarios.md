# Common Scenarios

Worked approaches for the most common user situations. Match the user's request to a scenario and follow the approach.

## Scenario 1: Starting from Scratch

**User request:** "We're a medical device startup and need to implement ISO 13485. Where do we start?"

**Approach:**
1. **Explain the journey:** ISO 13485 requires comprehensive QMS documentation; typically 6-12 months for full implementation; can be done incrementally.
2. **Start with foundation:** Quality Policy and Objectives; Quality Manual; organization structure and responsibilities.
3. **Follow the priority order:** use the Phase 1-6 priority list (see `references/document-creation-guide.md`); create documents in logical sequence; build on previously created documents.
4. **Key milestones:**
   - Month 1-2: Foundation documents (Quality Manual, policies)
   - Month 3-4: Core processes (CAPA, Complaints, Audits)
   - Month 5-6: Product realization processes
   - Month 7-8: Supporting processes
   - Month 9-10: Internal audits and refinement
   - Month 11-12: Management review and certification audit

## Scenario 2: Gap Analysis for Existing QMS

**User request:** "We have some procedures but don't know what we're missing for ISO 13485."

**Approach:**
1. **Run automated gap analysis:** ask for the document directory; run `scripts/gap_analyzer.py`; review automated findings.
2. **Conduct detailed assessment:** use the comprehensive checklist for the user's specific situation; go deeper than automated analysis; assess quality of existing documents, not just presence.
3. **Provide a prioritized gap list:** missing mandatory procedures; incomplete procedures; quality issues with existing documents; missing records or forms.
4. **Create a remediation plan:** high priority (safety-related, regulatory-required); medium priority (core QMS processes); low priority (improvement opportunities).

## Scenario 3: Creating a Specific Document

**User request:** "Help me create a CAPA procedure."

**Approach:**
1. **Explain requirements:** read ISO 13485 Clauses 8.5.2 and 8.5.3 from references; explain what must be in the CAPA procedure; provide examples of good CAPA processes.
2. **Use template:** start with the CAPA procedure template; explain each section's purpose; show what needs customization.
3. **Gather user-specific info:** how are CAPAs initiated in their organization? who are the responsible parties? what prioritization criteria make sense? what RCA methods will they use? what are appropriate timeframes?
4. **Create customized procedure:** replace all placeholders; adapt to the user's processes; ensure completeness.
5. **Add supporting materials:** CAPA request form; RCA worksheets; action plan template; effectiveness verification checklist.

## Scenario 4: Updating for Regulatory Changes

**User request:** "We need to update our QMS for FDA QMSR harmonization."

**Approach:**
1. **Explain changes:** 21 CFR Part 820 is now the QMSR (in effect since Feb 2, 2026), which incorporates ISO 13485:2016 by reference. The DMR/DHF/DHR terms are retired — the DMR maps to the medical device file (ISO 13485 clause 4.2.3), the DHF to the design and development file (7.3.10), and the DHR to the record kept for each device or batch (7.5.1). FDA-specific requirements remain (§ 820.10 UDI/traceability/MDR/corrections links, § 820.35 record content, § 820.45 labeling and packaging), and management review, internal audit, and supplier audit reports are now inspectable.
2. **Review current documentation:** identify documents citing QSR sections (820.30, 820.181, 820.184, 820.198, ...); map each DHF/DMR/DHR element to its ISO 13485 clause; check for ISO 13485 gaps (e.g. risk-based approach, software validation, outsourced-process controls).
3. **Update strategy:** re-cite QSR references to QMSR/ISO 13485 clauses; keep or restructure DHF/DMR/DHR files, as long as the mapping to 4.2.3 / 7.3.10 / 7.5.1 is explicit; add missing ISO 13485 requirements; prepare management review and audit records for FDA review.
4. **Create transition plan:** update the Quality Manual and procedure cross-references; update the MDF procedure; train personnel, including on the CP 7382.850 inspection approach.

## Scenario 5: Preparing for Certification Audit

**User request:** "We have our documentation ready. How do we prepare for the certification audit?"

**Approach:**
1. **Conduct a readiness assessment:** use the comprehensive gap analysis checklist; review all documentation for completeness; verify records exist for all required items; check for consistent implementation.
2. **Pre-audit checklist:**
   - [ ] All 31 procedures documented and approved
   - [ ] Quality Manual complete with all required content
   - [ ] Medical Device Files complete for all products
   - [ ] Internal audit completed with findings addressed
   - [ ] Management review completed
   - [ ] Personnel trained on QMS procedures
   - [ ] Records maintained per retention requirements
   - [ ] CAPA system functional with effectiveness demonstrated
   - [ ] Complaints system operational
3. **Conduct a mock audit:** use ISO 13485 requirements as audit criteria; sample records to verify consistent implementation; interview personnel to verify understanding; identify any non-conformances.
4. **Address findings:** correct any deficiencies; document corrections; verify effectiveness.
5. **Final preparation:** brief management and staff; prepare audit schedule; organize evidence and records; designate escorts and support personnel.
