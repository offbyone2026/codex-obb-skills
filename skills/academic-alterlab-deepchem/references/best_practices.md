# DeepChem Best Practices and Pitfalls

Recommended modeling patterns (with code) and a troubleshooting catalog of common failure modes, extracted from the skill overview.

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

### Pattern 1: Always Use Scaffold Splitting for Molecules
```python
# GOOD: Prevents data leakage
splitter = dc.splits.ScaffoldSplitter()
train, test = splitter.train_test_split(dataset)

# BAD: Similar molecules in train and test
splitter = dc.splits.RandomSplitter()
train, test = splitter.train_test_split(dataset)
```

### Pattern 2: Normalize Features and Targets
```python
transformers = [
    dc.trans.NormalizationTransformer(
        transform_y=True,  # Also normalize target values
        dataset=train
    )
]
for transformer in transformers:
    train = transformer.transform(train)
    test = transformer.transform(test)
```

### Pattern 3: Start Simple, Then Scale
1. Start with Random Forest + CircularFingerprint (fast baseline)
2. Try XGBoost/LightGBM if RF works well
3. Move to deep learning (MultitaskRegressor) if you have >5K samples
4. Try GNNs if you have >10K samples
5. Use transfer learning for small datasets or novel scaffolds

### Pattern 4: Handle Imbalanced Data
```python
# Option 1: Balancing transformer
transformer = dc.trans.BalancingTransformer(dataset=train)
train = transformer.transform(train)

# Option 2: Use balanced metrics
metric = dc.metrics.Metric(dc.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score)
```

### Pattern 5: Avoid Memory Issues
```python
# Use DiskDataset for large datasets
dataset = dc.data.DiskDataset.from_numpy(X, y, w, ids)

# Use smaller batch sizes
model = dc.models.GCNModel(batch_size=32)  # Instead of 128
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Issue 1: Data Leakage in Drug Discovery
**Problem**: Using random splitting allows similar molecules in train/test sets.
**Solution**: Always use `ScaffoldSplitter` for molecular datasets.

### Issue 2: GNN Underperforming vs Fingerprints
**Problem**: Graph neural networks perform worse than simple fingerprints.
**Solutions**:
- Ensure dataset is large enough (>10K samples typically)
- Increase training epochs (50-100)
- Try different architectures (AttentiveFP, DMPNN instead of GCN)
- Use pretrained models (GROVER)

### Issue 3: Overfitting on Small Datasets
**Problem**: Model memorizes training data.
**Solutions**:
- Use stronger regularization (increase dropout to 0.5)
- Use simpler models (Random Forest instead of deep learning)
- Apply transfer learning (ChemBERTa, GROVER)
- Collect more data

### Issue 4: Import Errors
**Problem**: Module not found errors.
**Solution**: Ensure DeepChem is installed with required dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install deepchem
# For PyTorch models
uv pip install deepchem[torch]
# Other backends
uv pip install "deepchem[tensorflow]"   # or [jax]; there is no [all] extra
```
