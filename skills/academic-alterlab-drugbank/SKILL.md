# DrugBank Database

## Overview

DrugBank is a comprehensive bioinformatics and cheminformatics database containing detailed information on drugs and drug targets. This skill enables programmatic access to DrugBank data: thousands of drug entries (FDA-approved small molecules, biotech/biologic drugs, nutraceuticals, and experimental compounds) with 200+ data fields per entry. Exact counts grow with each release — derive them from the version you download rather than quoting a fixed number (the 5.0-era figure was ~9,591 entries).

**Access status (checked 2026-09-23).** The current downloadable release is **5.1.22**
(2026-06-27). DrugBank's releases page states that *all academic dataset downloads are
temporarily paused* while it changes how data are distributed, and every download link
(including the CC0 "Open Data" vocabulary and structures) shows "Temporarily
unavailable" — scripted downloads return HTTP 403. Until access resumes, work from a
copy you already downloaded (pin and cite its version), check
https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest, or route the question to an open source listed
under "Does NOT Trigger". Academic data are licensed CC BY-NC 4.0; commercial use and
the Clinical API (`https://api.drugbank.com/v1/`, API-key header) need a paid license.

## When to Use This Skill

- Parsing a DrugBank XML release you have access to (drug records, targets, enzymes, transporters, pathways)
- Drug–drug interaction extraction and polypharmacy screening from DrugBank data
- Drug–target mapping and repurposing via shared targets or structural similarity
- Pulling DrugBank cross-references (UniProt, ChEMBL, PubChem, KEGG) for integration

### Does NOT Trigger

| Scenario | Use Instead |
|----------|-------------|
| FDA drug labels, FAERS adverse events, recalls, approvals (open data) | `alterlab-fda` |
| Compound bioactivity (IC50/Ki), mechanisms, and indications from open data | `alterlab-chembl` |
| Genotype-guided dosing / pharmacogene–drug pairs (CPIC, DPWG) | `alterlab-clinpgx` |
| KEGG DRUG entries, drug–pathway maps, KEGG drug–drug interactions | `alterlab-kegg` |
| Compound identifiers and properties by name/CID/SMILES | `alterlab-pubchem` |

### Account Setup
1. Create an account at go.drugbank.com
2. Apply for the Academic License (free for eligible, non-commercial academic research;
   data under CC BY-NC 4.0) or obtain a commercial license
3. Use your account email and password as download credentials (academic downloads
   were paused as of 2026-09 — see Access status above)
4. Configure credentials as documented in `references/data-access.md`

## Data Version and Reproducibility

Always specify the DrugBank version for reproducible research:

```python
from drugbank_downloader import download_drugbank
path = download_drugbank(version='5.1.22')  # Pin an exact version (5.1.22 = 2026-06-27)
```

Document the version used in publications and analysis scripts.

## Best Practices

1. **Credentials**: Use environment variables or config files, never hardcode
2. **Versioning**: Specify exact database version for reproducibility
3. **Caching**: Cache parsed data to avoid re-downloading and re-parsing
4. **Namespaces**: Handle XML namespaces properly when parsing
5. **Validation**: Validate chemical structures with RDKit before use
6. **Cross-referencing**: Use external identifiers (UniProt, PubChem) for integration
7. **Clinical Context**: Always consider clinical context when interpreting interaction data
8. **License Compliance**: Ensure proper licensing for your use case
