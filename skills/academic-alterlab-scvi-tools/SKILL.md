# scvi-tools

## Overview

scvi-tools is a comprehensive Python framework for probabilistic models in single-cell genomics. Built on PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, it provides deep generative models using variational inference for analyzing diverse single-cell data modalities.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data (dimensionality reduction, batch correction, integration)
- Working with single-cell ATAC-seq or chromatin accessibility data
- Integrating multimodal data (CITE-seq, multiome, paired/unpaired datasets)
- Analyzing spatial transcriptomics data (deconvolution, spatial mapping)
- Performing differential expression analysis on single-cell data
- Conducting cell type annotation or transfer learning tasks
- Working with specialized single-cell modalities (methylation, cytometry, RNA velocity)
- Building custom probabilistic models for single-cell analysis

### Does NOT Trigger

| Scenario | Use Instead |
|----------|-------------|
| Standard QC -> normalize -> HVG -> PCA -> UMAP -> Leiden -> marker DE | `alterlab-scanpy` |
| Reading, reshaping, or concatenating the `.h5ad` object itself | `alterlab-anndata` |
| Zero-shot annotation or embeddings from a pretrained foundation model | `alterlab-scgpt` |
| RNA velocity from spliced/unspliced counts (scVelo's EM/dynamical models) | `alterlab-scvelo` |
| Spatial neighborhood statistics, Moran's I, ligand-receptor on a Visium/Xenium slide | `alterlab-squidpy-spatial` |
| Bulk RNA-seq differential expression | `alterlab-pydeseq2` |

## Core Capabilities

- **CellAssign**: Marker-based cell type annotation

## Typical Workflow

All scvi-tools models follow a consistent API pattern:

```python
# 1. Load and preprocess data (AnnData format)
import scvi
import scanpy as sc

adata = scvi.data.heart_cell_atlas_subsampled()
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_counts=3)
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, n_top_genes=1200)

# 2. Register data with model (specify layers, covariates)
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(
    adata,
    layer="counts",  # Use raw counts, not log-normalized
    batch_key="batch",
    categorical_covariate_keys=["donor"],
    continuous_covariate_keys=["percent_mito"]
)

# 3. Create and train model
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
model.train()

# 4. Extract latent representations and normalized values
latent = model.get_latent_representation()
normalized = model.get_normalized_expression(library_size=1e4)

# 5. Store in AnnData for downstream analysis
adata.obsm["X_scVI"] = latent
adata.layers["scvi_normalized"] = normalized

# 6. Downstream analysis with scanpy
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, use_rep="X_scVI")
sc.tl.umap(adata)
sc.tl.leiden(adata)
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Raw counts required**: Models expect unnormalized count data for optimal performance
- **Unified API**: Consistent interface across all models (setup → train → extract)
- **AnnData-centric**: Seamless integration with the scanpy ecosystem
- **GPU acceleration**: Automatic utilization of available GPUs
- **Batch correction**: Handle technical variation through covariate registration

## Common Analysis Tasks

### Differential Expression
Probabilistic DE analysis using the learned generative models:

```python
de_results = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="TypeA",
    group2="TypeB",
    mode="change",  # composite hypothesis testing with an effect-size threshold
    delta=0.25,     # minimum |LFC| to count as a real change
)

# Significance lives in proba_de (posterior prob. of DE), NOT a p-value.
# In "change" mode this is the posterior prob. that |LFC| > delta.
sig = de_results[de_results["proba_de"] > 0.95]
```

See `references/differential-expression.md` for the full output schema and interpretation.

### Model Persistence
Save and load trained models:

```python
# Save model
model.save("./model_directory", overwrite=True)

# Load model
model = scvi.model.SCVI.load("./model_directory", adata=adata)
```

### Batch Correction and Integration
Integrate datasets across batches or studies:

```python
# Register batch information
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(adata, batch_key="study")

# Model automatically learns batch-corrected representations
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
model.train()
latent = model.get_latent_representation()  # Batch-corrected
```

## Theoretical Foundations

scvi-tools is built on:
- **Variational inference**: Approximate posterior distributions for scalable Bayesian inference
- **Deep generative models**: VAE architectures that learn complex data distributions
- **Amortized inference**: Shared neural networks for efficient learning across cells
- **Probabilistic modeling**: Principled uncertainty quantification and statistical testing

See `references/theoretical-foundations.md` for detailed background on the mathematical framework.

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install scvi-tools
uv pip install "scvi-tools[cuda]"      # CUDA 12; use [cuda13] for CUDA 13
uv pip install "scvi-tools[metal]"     # Apple silicon (MPS)
uv pip install "scvi-tools[autotune]"  # hyperparameter search (Ray Tune)
```

Version note (2026-09): scvi-tools 1.5 dropped the JAX backend entirely, so `scvi.model.JaxSCVI`
and the other Jax-prefixed models no longer exist — everything runs on PyTorch/Lightning (with an
`mlxSCVI` variant for Apple silicon). `Tangram` also moved to a PyTorch backend in 1.5.0, so
results can differ slightly from JAX-era runs; re-run rather than mixing old and new outputs in
one comparison.

## Best Practices

1. **Use raw counts**: Always provide unnormalized count data to models
2. **Filter genes**: Remove low-count genes before analysis (e.g., `min_counts=3`)
3. **Register covariates**: Include known technical factors (batch, donor, etc.) in `setup_anndata`
4. **Feature selection**: Use highly variable genes for improved performance
5. **Model saving**: Always save trained models to avoid retraining
6. **GPU usage**: Enable GPU acceleration for large datasets (`accelerator="gpu"`)
7. **Scanpy integration**: Store outputs in AnnData objects for downstream analysis
