name: media-proxy
description: Shared helper that routes ALL paid media generation (FAL image/video, ElevenLabs music) through the GooseWorks proxies so every call bills the Ads agent — never a provider SDK's default host. Host-swaps the FAL queue URLs, loads the agent token from the sandbox env (GW_MEDIA_PROXY_TOKEN) or ~/.gooseworks/credentials.json, and returns the result CDN URL. Every video-ad media capability imports this; templates never call a provider directly.

# media-proxy

The foundation capability for paid media in the video-ad pipeline. It fixes the
auth-path conflict where engine scripts called FAL/ElevenLabs **directly** (billing
the wrong account): all paid calls now go through
`<api_base>/api/internal/{fal-proxy,elevenlabs-proxy}` with `?token=&agent_id=`, which
**bills the Ads agent**.

## Crash-resume (never lose / double-bill a paid render)

A FAL submit BILLS immediately, but the local backend can blip during a multi-minute
render. Two built-in protections (automatic for every capability that imports this):
- **Poll-through-outage** — `_fal_run`'s poll loop re-attaches to the same status/result
  URL through `connection refused` / timeout blips instead of crashing.
- **Persist + resume** — each submit's `request_id` + poll URLs are written to
  `~/.gooseworks/pending-fal-jobs/`. If the poller still dies, **re-attach instead of
  re-firing** (re-firing double-bills): `resume_fal(request_id)` in Python, or the CLI:

  ```bash
  resume.py --list                              # resumable (submitted, unfinished) jobs
  resume.py --request-id <id> --out final.mp4   # poll to completion + download
  ```
  `resume_fal` NEVER re-submits, so it can't double-charge.
- **Poll timeout never resubmits (GOOSE-3729)** — polling gives up after
  `default_poll_timeout(model)`: **1800s for video / lipsync / audio-driven models**,
  600s for images (`GW_FAL_POLL_TIMEOUT_S` overrides; `timeout_s=` per call). A timeout
  raises `FalPollTimeout` carrying `.request_id` + `.model_path` — the job is still
  running and already paid for. **Re-attach with `resume_fal(e.request_id)`; never call
  `fal_generate*` again for it** (a veed/fabric lipsync once finished 26s after a 600s
  poller quit, and the retry paid for a second identical job).
- **Proxy dedupe back-stop** — the fal proxy returns the already-running job for an
  identical submit (same agent + model + body) within 30 min, so an accidental
  resubmit re-attaches instead of paying twice (response header `x-gw-deduped: 1`).
  For a **deliberate re-roll** of the same input (want a new take), pass
  `new_take=True` (`fal_generate(..., new_take=True)` / `fal_generate_video(...)`),
  which sends `x-gw-no-dedupe: 1` (raw HTTP callers: that header or `?dedupe=0`).
- **Pass `input_digest=` for any piece you save as an ingredient, so a resumed run
  never pays twice.** The body-match dedupe above breaks after a sandbox restart: the
  resumed run re-uploads its inputs (voiceover, stills) and gets NEW urls, so the body
  differs. `fal_generate*(..., input_digest=d)` sends `x-gw-input-digest: d`; the proxy
  then dedupes on (agent + model + digest) for **24 h** and returns the job you already
  paid for. Use the same stable digest you save with `media_upload` (see below). If
  that job's result has since expired at fal, the poll fails: retry once with
  `new_take=True`.

## Use it

```python
from media_proxy import fal_generate, fal_generate_video, eleven_music, download

# image (nano-banana / gpt-image / etc.) — inputs must be PUBLIC urls
img = fal_generate("fal-ai/nano-banana/edit",
                   {"prompt": p, "image_urls": [product_url], "aspect_ratio": "9:16"})
# video i2v (kling / seedance / veo)
vid = fal_generate_video("fal-ai/kling-video/v2.1/standard/image-to-video",
                         {"prompt": p, "image_url": keyframe_url, "duration": "10"})
# music bed
eleven_music(prompt, 10500, "music.mp3", force_instrumental=True)
```

## Save-as-you-go digest (GOOSE-3731)

`input_digest(model, args)` = sha256 of the canonical JSON `{"model", "args"}` (sorted
keys, no whitespace), first 32 hex chars. Pass it with the MCP `media_upload` of the
result (plus an `ingredient_key` such as `vo/scene-03`); on a resume, `media_list
{ ingredient_key }` returns the saved file and its digest, and the file is reused only
when the digest of the args you would send now is the same.

```python
from media_proxy import input_digest, eleven_tts, fal_generate_video
args = {"text": line, "voice_id": vid, "model_id": "eleven_v3"}
digest = input_digest("elevenlabs/tts", args)

# FAL job: hash the STABLE identities of its inputs, not their urls, and send the
# same digest with the submit so a resumed run re-attaches instead of re-paying.
lip_digest = input_digest("veed/fabric-1.0", {"image": "still/scene-03:" + still_digest,
                                              "audio": "vo/scene-03:" + digest})
clip = fal_generate_video("veed/fabric-1.0", {"image_url": still_url, "audio_url": vo_url},
                          input_digest=lip_digest)
```

Hash only what determines the output. Swap any expiring input URL (presigned / proxy)
for that input's own ingredient_key + digest first, or the digest never matches.

## Contracts (load-bearing)

- **Bills the Ads agent** — `?token=&agent_id=` from `~/.gooseworks/credentials.json`
  (the CLI writes it; run `gooseworks login` if missing). In a GooseWorks cloud sandbox
  (coworker chat) the env wins instead: `GW_MEDIA_PROXY_TOKEN` (a per-session token that
  already binds agent/org/user) + `GW_API_BASE`; `GW_PROJECT_ID` attributes spend.
- **Host-swap the FAL queue URLs** — submit returns `status_url`/`response_url` on
  `queue.fal.run`; the helper rewrites them to the proxy base (keeps the path). Never
  poll `queue.fal.run` directly (401 + burns credits).
- **FAL inputs that are local files must be PUBLIC urls.** The orchestrator hosts a
  local image/audio via the MCP `get_upload_url` → `get_download_url` presigned URL and
  passes THAT url in, or call `fal_upload(path)`, which puts the file on the fal CDN
  through the fal-storage-proxy (free, verified 2026-09-28) and returns its public url.
- **Only the final `*.fal.media` url is a real public URL** — everything else is behind
  the proxy.

## No credentials at all? The MCP relay

A session that only has the GooseWorks MCP connector (the Claude desktop app, a Codex
session without `gooseworks login`) has neither `GW_MEDIA_PROXY_TOKEN` (the cloud sandbox's)
nor `~/.gooseworks/credentials.json`, so scripts cannot reach the proxies over HTTP. Then every paid call is **relayed through the agent**:

1. The script writes the exact MCP tool call to `working/mcp-requests/<kind>-<hash>.json`
   and exits with code **3**, printing what to do.
2. The agent makes that call through the connector:
   - fal → `data_post_provider { provider: "fal", path: <model>, body, project_id }`, then
     `job_get { job_id }` until `complete`; save `result.output` (fal's JSON).
   - ElevenLabs → `data_post_provider { provider: "elevenlabs", ... }`; save the reply
     (it carries `download_url`).
   - A local file → `media_upload { scope: "video_project", ... }` with the bytes of
     `local_file`; save `{ "url": <its url> }`.
3. It saves that JSON to `save_result_to` and **re-runs the same command**. The script finds
   the result and continues; the next paid call relays the same way.

Set `GW_PROJECT_ID` (required: every call is billed to that video project, the same
attribution the HTTP proxy records) and `GW_BRAND_ID` (for uploads). The MCP tools bill
through the same server proxy code, so price and project attribution are identical.
`GW_MEDIA_VIA=mcp` forces the relay (e.g. the CLI login points at another environment);
`GW_MEDIA_VIA=proxy` forces HTTP.
